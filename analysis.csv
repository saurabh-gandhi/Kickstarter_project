Using my knowledge and skills as a graphic designer, I taught myself how to turn hand drawn sketches into digital paintings using Photoshop and a mouse(that's right, no tablet). The series was both an artistic experiment and a personal challenge. I quickly developed a new style using a medium in a different way than I ever had before, and created odd compositions based on ideas gathered from everything happening around me. At the time, it was mostly just college.Most of the series was created within the 3 1/2 months leading up to the show.Check out my Deviantart gallery to see the full views; http://kyle-lefort.deviantart.com/gallery/42410522Even after the show had ended, I kept creating more illustrations because I want to continue developing this new-ish digital style of mine, I really think it will eventually turn into some meaningful work, and it's something that I enjoy doing. A handful of prints were made and sold locally, but my illustration work has since been metaphorically collecting dust due to a lack of an ongoing venue or purpose.(At best, I've got a few misc. & WIP pieces with nowhere to go).My clients are usually looking more for my graphic design services and the editors/publishers I've spoken to so far aren't really sure that my illustration style would work out for them (although, I've been told it's cool to look at). Locally, my work is well received though, and many of the people I've met online seem to enjoy it too.So, I've decided to take my illustration work to Kickstarter, to see if it can be turned into something a little more productive. I would love to illustrate a book, but until I find my audience, I'm trying to keep projects fairly simple. Sticking with what I know, I plan on making another series of open-ended concept illustrations. The twist? This new series involves you.----++----Interested? Then here comes the details.----++----There are 3 parts to The Curious Concepts Project;1. Create an opportunity for more people to see my work.åÊIf this is your first time seeing my illustrations, we just reached goal #1. (Hello)åÊ>Whether or not you choose to be a backer for my project, just sending more people my way would be tremendously helpful. Feel free to share the link to this project with everyone (If I don't get the chance later-Thank You!)2. Raise the funds needed to get my current series of illustrations available as prints online.Why I need to raise funds;Being able to sell prints at one location, year round will allow me the excuse to keep working on illustrations, and make online commissions a little easier to arrange. Paying retail for half this stuff would mean jacking up the prices on my prints sold online (not an ideal plan), but locally I have yet to sell enough in one go to cover the up front supply costs for online sales. I shelved the the idea for a year, and look-nothing has changed. So, with your help, I can reach my project goal, and you can get some neat stuff along the way. 3. Create a whole New Series-Influenced by my SupportersWhy am I looking to you for inspiration? To butcher a well known saying: It's not like artists just sit alone on an island constantly pulling awesome ideas out of their heads. All of my work was inspired in part by something or someone; ""Mantis"" is the cartoony depiction of a dead Peacock Mantid that happened to be in a display case nearby, ""Bow Season"" was the result of a conversation during a class that had gone way off topic, and ""It's Under Control"", is a whimsical re-imagining of the classic mythic hero, inspired by a very intense folklore course.åÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊåÊ To list a few of them.My experience as an artist has taught me that everyone has their own opinion about what the end result of my work should be, and as a graphic designer I like that kind of creative challenge. So, why not?----++----The plan for this new series is to create illustrations based on some backer chosen guidelines. Progress of the work will be documented on my blog,åÊ http://kyle-lefort.blogspot.com/ , which allows for comments and feedback. And while specific backers are going to get the ball rolling on this part of the project, I plan on opening up some of the later decision making to anyone with access to my Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Kyle.K.Lefort).Once these new illustrations are completed, backers who directly contributed to the new series, as indicated by the pledge reward tiers, will be sent a print of the finished work that they influenced. Additional prints will then be made available for purchase online alongside the original, ""Curious Concepts"", series-to everyone else.What happens to the new series after that? This project is to create the series and make it available online, so we'll all just have to wait and see where it goes from there.Goals & Pledge Rewards;Goal: -------------------------------------------------------------->$600----++----More info in the Updates section; http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/690850738/the-curious-concepts-project/posts/464123***UPDATE: New-Unlocked Pledge Rewards!***Unlocked Pledge Reward #2, Postcards! While the proportions of most of my illustrations don't nicely scale down to the standard 4x6 in. postcard, after some tasteful touch-ups and cropping, I've created 6 possible options. I plan to mail them to you in an envelope so that they'll still be new and usable when you get them. Keep them as tiny frame-able prints, or mail them as postcards to friends!The smallest run has to be 100 postcards, and this is an extra reward, which means that I can't just have all 6 options printed for this project. So...Based on a Facebook vote; (Vote by commenting here;åÊåÊhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=438513526239738&set=a.328345020589923.73494.172248969532863&type=1 )Current goal- $600 = 1 image available, Most popular imageStretch goal- $650 = 2 to choose from, Top 2 Stretch goal- $700 = 3 to choose from, Top 3...And so on. To get these you've got to pledge for them, $3-$10, but since there will be at least 100 printed, Postcards will be sent to all backers-$15 pledges & up. Unlocked Reward #1-The Whole Series! A Kickstarter Exclusive Offer, 12 loose prints, 1 for each illustration, from the original Curious Concepts series! Save $160 off the retail price, and shipping's included, Plus I'll also include a letter stating who/when/where your prints came from (Me, the artist, through Kickstarter, you were being awesome). Backers for this reward will be the first people, other than myself, to own a copy of them all. How cool is that? Feel free to brag about it. :)Better hurry though, there's a 2 backer limit!----++----Small Pledges;Thank You! Every dollar helps. All backers will be listed in a special 'Thank You' post on my blog; http://kyle-lefort.blogspot.com/ And then again on a brand new ""Supporters"" page on my website, http://www.kylelefort.com/ , at a later date (it's next planned update).If you would rather be listed as 'anonymous', let me know.-----An Amusing ""Thank You"" Letter.Because, ""Thanks for the Money, You Rock"", would be pathetic, and I seem to have an interest in self-imposed challenges lately-I'll give poetry a shot. Haiku, here I come!No promises that it will be any good(or even a true Haiku), but it also includes an original drawing, which should be an amusing surprise, because by drawing, I mean something similar to this;Or this;Or this;I'm going to make them up as I go, free-handed in pen, so each letter will be both a surprise and a true one of a kind. Don't care for poetry? I'm fine with just making an awesome drawing for you. :)And you also get the $1 pledge reward.Please note; These will be folded up and mailed as letters. I may make copies, but you are getting the original. Because I'm planning on an hour or two per drawing, there's a 40 backer limit for this reward. If we hit the $600 goal though, I may add more.-----Pledges for Prints;I've got six,åÊ 8x10in. loose prints in my inventory right now. ^^^Those 6 ^^^Most of them are metallic prints, but a couple of them are glossy prints.

Because I have no way of knowing what's going to end up on my agenda until the pledges come in, or how many of these will be claimed by backers, they will not be kept in any sort of order. (the list is just to show how many spots are left)That's going to be one of the first decisions to be left up to the public after this campaign ends.Pick the Colors! You get to choose a color(or 2...or 3) and help to set the tone for one of my next illustrations.Contact me with your color scheme idea after pledging, and I'll list it here;1. Navy blue, purple,  and ""silver""2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.(List indicates backer suggestions, and are not in any specific order).Once these illustrations are finished you'll receive an 'Extra Special' version of the $1 & $15 rewards, and a print of the finished piece that you helped inspire me to make.Choose the Characters!You get to make up the character(s) for one of my next illustrations.Contact me with your character idea after pledging, and I'll list it here;1. A skydiver. Not a literal one,...the ""spirit"" of a skydiver...Freedom and clarity and peace...Rebirth and Transformation.Can't include commonly used symbols, the phoenix or a butterfly, etc.(These are my notes, She wrote up a whole paragraph for me to work from)2. A Bunny! I'm drawing a bunny!3. Ideas-coming soon!4. Ideas-coming soon!5.6.7.8.9.10.(List indicates backer suggestions, and are not in any specific order).What ever you can think of, I'll try to illustrate it. Not sure what to suggest? Most nouns should work. Adjectives also welcome. Just a few words or an entire paragraph or two, doesn't matter, I'm not that picky.A few ground rules here though(let's not turn this into a total mess);Please keep it PG.I maintain all legal rights to my illustrations. Tell me what you'd like to see me illustrate, but keep it vague enough that I don't end up with my own copyrighted version ofyour original characters. No copyrighted material, real people, anything that's illegal, or promotes hate.And although in the spirit of this project I have no plans to shoot down anyone's ideas, if there's something I can't/won't draw for any reason(it's got to be a big reason though), I'm allowed to say no-and then let you suggest something else.Once these illustrations are finished you'll receive an 'Extra Special' version of the $1 & $15 rewards, and a print of the finished piece that you helped inspire me to make.-----There are more rewards that I would like to post. For instance, I would like backers to have an opportunity to getåÊ an early bird special on the (hopefully) new series that I am about to start, but it seems weird to promise prints of my work before I get any input as to what that work will actually be. If I see a good response to this project in the first week or so of it's launch I will gladly add more of these rewards to the mix.(also open to suggestions if anyone has them)åÊ----++----Want to get involved, but can't make a pledge?Once I begin work on the new series, much of the input and group decision making will be left open to the public. You can still be a part of it, but only if this campaign succeeds.If you want to help make this possible, re-post, re-blog, re-tweet, Like, and Share. Send it out and spread the word, I can't do this without you. (Thank you!)Printing & Planned Online Locations;I have my illustration work printed locally. Technically, by 'Prints' or 'Digital Prints', I mean that they are Photographic prints created from digital files. They're developed just like film on Kodak Endura Professional Paper, with a metallic print surface. They're high quality prints and the colors are stunning (and they will stay that way for a long, long time). To keep shipping simple and the initial costs low, these will just be loose prints, protected with plastic sleeves, shipped in rigid mailers. Print sizes run from 8x8in. to 8x12in. (most are 8x10 in.) depending on the illustration, so it shouldn't be difficult to frame them yourself should you choose to later.----++----I currently run an Etsy shop selling craft work, and also accept online commission/freelance graphic design work from a growing number of clients. I have experience selling my illustration work locally and am confident thatåÊ I can manage the switch to an online venue. Prints of my original, ""Curious Concepts"", seriesåÊ will be available through my Etsy shop, and in certain cases, by contacting me directly. I am still looking into other possible places for my work, but starting with this arrangement will allow me to dive right into working on the new series.",11,1,2592000,20,54.54545454545455,1.0961538461538467,1.0961538461538467

The Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600) is generally considered one of the worst video games of all time.åÊ Plagued by a short development window, with just 5 weeks (!) in which to create the game, E.T. fell far short of expectations.åÊ No one could even figure out how to play the game, as demonstrated well by this YouTube video that has accumulated nearly 2 million hits (warning: language).When combined with Atari's over-production (more units of the E.T. game were produced than actual Atari 2600 systems produced by that time), E.T. became the perfect storm and collapsed Atari completely, taking the rest of the industry with it in what became known as the Video Game Crash of 1983.åÊ Eventually, the massive surplus of E.T. cartridges would be taken en masse and buried in a New Mexico landfill, becoming a mythical final chapter in a legendary story of gaming's yesteryear.Fast-forward 30 years later, and video games are bigger than they have ever been.åÊ Mobile devices, personal computers, home consoles, and hand-held video game consoles are everywhere.åÊ Video games are ubiquitous and an accepted part of our culture.As gaming has grown, the interest in learning about the history of the video game industry also has grown, both from older gamers who have a sense of nostalgia and from younger gamers who want to learn about gaming's roots.åÊ Video games have been around long enough now to where they are bringing entire generations of people together to play and have fun.We had the idea to ""roast"" the E.T. video game and want to share it with you, the gamer, the collector, the fan.åÊ This game truly deserves the best of the worst treatment we can dish out, deserving a giant 24""x36"" poster to parody the worst game of all time and capture the humor in full detail.Our concept for this artwork is to imagine the E.T. box art, progressed 30 years into the future.åÊ Elliott lives in his mom's basement, is somewhat overweight, enjoys liberal amounts of World of WarCraft, is a regular at comic book conventions, loves his ""wolves howling at the moon"" shirt, and has E.T. exasperated at how their shared 80's-era idealism has now given way to the cold, hard reality of the 21st century.åÊ Things haven't quite gone as planned.åÊ Even E.T.'s glowing finger doesn't work right anymore - it's fizzled out.They are still together, using Elliott's phone not to ""phone home"" but instead using the GPS to locate the landfill where all those un-sold and un-wanted E.T. video games are buried!You may notice the background of the original box art is quite busy, with various random things going on - Reese's pieces strewn about, the mothership in the sky, the shadowy government agents in the bottom left, and more.åÊ We've updated these with some hilarious additions: This is our interpretation of the art, anyway.åÊ Maybe you have a different one.åÊ We'd love to hear what you think is happening in the picture!The posters will be printed on thick, high-quality poster stock and coated in a protective UV gloss treatment.åÊ They will be shipped in cardboard movie poster tubes for the utmost protection.åÊ We will come up with the precise final number of posters as we approach the end of the Kickstarter project window, but once it ends, that will be the final total, forever.åÊ We know all of these posters will find good homes all over the world, which is a dream fulfilled for us.One poster is $25 (or $35 shipped anywhere in the world) and there are a limited number of autographed posters available for $45 (or $57 shipped internationally).åÊ The autographed posters come with another little bonus: a replica ""cartridge label"" sticker that could be used to replace the original cartridge label on an Atari 2600 cart!åÊ How cool is that?åÊ Only a very limited number of these are being made, and will ship with the autographed posters.Other reward levels are available as well for the mildly-passionate observer ($1 minimum helps fund us, lets you stay up-to-date on the project with updates emailed directly to you, and you receive a high-resolution wallpaper JPG upon successful completion of the project) along with the E.T. super-fan ($250 for all rewards, including poster autographed by the three project creators, limited edition cartridge label, and a hand-written thank-you letter from Roasted Games founder Bradley Metrock thanking you for being a true patron of our work).The funds raised will be used to cover the production of the poster and cartridge label, and funding up to and exceeding our stretch goal will be used to fund successive Roasted Games projects and marketing.åÊ We want to keep bringing you guys awesome, hilarious new projects to enjoy.This E.T. artwork and concept will be discussed at the upcoming ScoreCon 3 video game convention in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 27-28, where we will also announce this project as the first of many ""Roasted Games"" that we will parody.åÊ Days later, this Kickstarter will conclude and we will begin fulfilling orders for the E.T. poster in May as soon as they arrive from the printer!THANK YOU to all who back us -

You can have a chainsaw through your chest, be as gnarly or as fresh as you want! åÊAs soon as backing is complete and the final number of flesh eaters is confirmed I will get to work on the layout of the piece and let people know how the layout of the final artwork.An example of how one segment of the poster may lookOnce every portrait is 100% finished, I will then stitch the pieces together to produce the final epic zombie landscape! åÊAt this stage backers will receive a digital version of their Zombie Portrait. åÊPrints will be exclusive to the qualified backers and each will be fully inspected, signed and numbered before the final shipping.Also, every pledge of å£5 (approx. $7) and above will receive a genuine ZombieDollar Bill which can be exchanged for canned goods and shotgun shells once the zombie apocalypse is upon us! åÊWhile not really legal tender in any sense of the word, all ZombieDollars will be sent out to backers as soon as the project is successfully backed.I hope this is something people can get behind. åÊIt's something I'm excited to work on and I love the idea of helping folk become part of the zombie apocalypse without the usual hassle of rage infected chimps, fallen satellites or alien brain slugs!Thanks everyone,Nik HolmesChief Gravedigger at Zombiedollar Creative",15,1,2592000,23,80.0,4.096153846153847,4.096153846153847
