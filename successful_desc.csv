215," Hi! I'm a California letterpress printer who has made the letterpress printed zine Ker-bloom! every other month since 1996, as well as the driving force behind the Letterpress Print of the Month Club.Due to a gluttony of listening to Sigur Rí_s, I have become a tiny bit obsessed with Iceland and its only native mammal, the arctic fox. As part of my Print of the Month Club, I recently made a three-color print of the arctic fox with its Icelandic name ""melrakki"" beside it from handset metal type.When Kickstarter announced the revival of its Make 100 campaign, I accepted the challenge to do a larger edition of the melrakki print with a slightly different color combination. The layout and illustration will be the same, but I would like to substitute a pewter color ink for the black, and use blue for the name and horizon line instead of gold.I am offering the global Kickstarter community the opportunity to get one of these limited edition letterpress prints, along with some other add-on rewards, such as letterpress zines and business cards."

226," Hi! I'm a fantasy artist and illustrator who loves dragons, nature, the stars and fantastical magical things!I've been creating art since I was very young, and dragons have always held a special place in my heart. I grew up in Montana under the ""Big Sky"" as it's called, and I vividly remember going outside on dark nights where the stars could be seen so clearly. I always felt a special connection to the stars and moon, so what better way to combine three of the things I hold dear than to create this beautiful enamel pin!~ I am excited to bring this project to Kickstarter with the help of the Make 100 event ~ŒæI chose a high-quality style of pin called cloisonní©. The creation process uses glass resins that give the pin a hard, glossy and impressive surface finish. The moon will be filled using a white-yellowish resin that will glow in the dark once charged in light.

I designed this model in 2012 and nowŒæI'm making prints of the Origami Roast Turkey instructions on traditional handmade Japanese paper (11x17""),Œæso that you can get a beautiful poster and fold your very own Origami Roast Turkey.There are two types of prints that will be available as rewards: Digital prints and Screen Prints.Digital PrintsThe digital prints will be laser printed on a sublime Kuzuki Kozo White paper. It's handmade in Japan. If you look closely you can see every imperfection and fibre.ŒæScreen PrintsŒæScreen Printing is a process where you transfer ink through a stencil-like mesh. It's incredibly versatile and can be used to create sharp and bold images.ŒæThe screen prints are part of a limited edition set, of which only 100 will be produced. They will be signed and numbered. I'm currently looking for the best paper to print on and will probably settle on a thick fibrous Kozo paper. The screen print will be similar to the digital print, except that the colours will pop a bit more and the paper will feel heavier.Once the campaign is over I'll finalize the paper, make the prints and send them to you! Both the digital and screen prints make great posters or wall hangings.ŒæThey'll be 11x17"" in size. If you've never interacted with traditional handmade paper before you're in for a treat. It's in a class of its own.You can if you want to! The prints are instructions as well as artwork. Both printsŒæcome with two sheets ofŒæhigh quality 10x10"" origami paper and an instructional video, where I walk you through all the steps as well as give you tips on folding.ŒæIt doesn't matter if you've never made any origami before. I've had a lot of success teaching this model to people of all ages and skill levels. You are going to be able to fold this, and you'll be extremely satisfied when you're holding your very own Origami Roast Turkey! Here's what the whole process looks like (don't be intimidated):Thanks for reading this far! I hope you back the project and start your journey towards folding your very own Origami Roast Turkey!Œæ"

229," Kickstarting a limited edition /make100 golden version of the ""don't complain, suggest what's better"" sticker which has been super popular in local communities. Additionally, three Belgian artists will create an illustration based on the quote - which will be produced as artprints and digital wallpapers. We're also offering the possibility to order a stack of 'original' stickers.It all started when I read a tweet by @moleitau, which stated ""don't complain, suggest what's better"". As time went by, I kept on revisiting this quote as it is so relevant in our current society. People are super good at complaining and nagging and do not automatically make the switch to suggesting, exploring or contributing to a possible solution.In 2017 I finally turned this quote into a sticker. I spread the sticker through a Belgian makerspace, and my friend Anthony has been promoting it heavily in the local community.The popularity of this first print run got me into launching it as a crowdfunding campaign. At its core, this campaign gets you a pack of 15 'original' stickers - I've seen a lot of them on laptops or smartphones. Both ideal devices to bring into company meetings and silently spread the message.We could have run a crowdfunding campaign to just get some more prints done of the existing design. But the Kickstarter /Make100 seemed like a nice opportunity to go further!This is huge! We're doing a super limited run of screenprinted stickers with black ink on shiny gold vinyl. There will only be 100 packs of 5 gold stickers made available ... ever. The design will be an iteration of the original sticker design, which will be made public as soon as possible!As part of this campaign, I want to take the chance to give back to the local community as much as possible. Therefore I invited 3 local (Antwerp based) artists to create something special based on the original quote. The artworks will be printed in A5 size on high quality 300g focuscard paper. They will also be made available as mobile and desktop wallpapers in various sizes.The examples below are to illustrate the diverse style of each artist. They do not reflect the final design. The custom artwork will only happen (and start) in case this project is fully funded.Invited artist #1 : Geertrui Storms (stormscreative.be)Geertrui is a lettering wizard. When this campaign gets funded - she'll make a supercustom version of the 'don't complain' quote.Invited artist #2 : Willem Pirquin (willempirquin.be, instagram)Willem is great at capturing a whole story in one image. He'll create a custom illustration, in his own vibrant style.Invited artist #3 : Bert Jacobs (instagram, behance)Bert is an industrial designer who eats marker pens for breakfast. He's not a 'genuine' illustrator, but he's totally up for this challenge.Note: All reward levels also include 'the digital' reward, containing a selection of wallpapers for tablet, phone and desktop use.Thanks to this campaign awesome backer crowd, we managed to reach 3 stretch goals already! I'm exploring other ways to keep expanding this campaign, and hope to land something feasible soon. Final stretch goal : ä‰å3200 ¥Ë_After getting several requests for doing a large size print, I'll be tossing in a risograph printed A3 sized poster of the quote for every backer who's backing at ä‰å20 and above.A riso print has a very special aesthetic to it, which makes it stand out. Larger prints would be ideal to pin in meeting rooms or on office walls.Stretch goal #3 : ä‰å3000 äìƒSticker sheet! I'm adding an A5 sticker sheet into the mix as an additional reward at all backer tiers! On this sheet there will be one sticker of each illustrator, and if there's space left I'll squeeze in a couple of 'localised versions' of the original quote!Stretch goal #2 : ä‰å2600 äìƒWe'll be adding one additional illustrator into the mix when reaching ä‰å2600! : Caroline of Studio Caro. She's totally into 3D type, and I think her style will add nicely to Willem, Geertrui and Bert's. Caroline also operates from Antwerp, so we're staying very local.The art created by Caro will be added to the tiers which already contain artprints. That means that you'll get 4 instead of 3 different prints if you backed either the ä‰å20 or ä‰å25 tier ('the art' or 'gold limited edition & art').Example work of Studio CaroExample work of Studio CaroStretch goal #1 : ä‰å2000 äìƒWhen the campaign reaches ä‰å2000 I'm committing to providing a nicely bundled package of design files in various formats. Documenting the fonts and listing a couple of printing resources. This should give anyone who backed at any tier level the opportunity to create her or his own version of the sticker, or re-use the digital version where ever you'd like.I want to go full transparent here. This is what I've based my calculations on, it's hard to estimate print quantities - but I tried to go with a realistic estimate.

The most cost effective way to publish my book is to purchase the equipment myself to reduce costs.Once the equipment is purchased and the coloring books are available.

To celebrate these past 10 yearäó»s worth of daily drawings I am going to make a book featuring my favorites.The book will be about 100 pages and include drawings ranging from 2007 through 2017. Iäó»ve remastered a bunch of the old ones, and there will be a few other surprises including illustrations by some awesome friends. This book wouldnäó»t be a good fit for a regular publisher so Iäó»m using Kickstarter to help produce it. This book is deeply personal and I want full control over it. So thatäó»s where you come in! By preordering a copy of my book, or backing the project via a whole slew of reward options you can make this happen (THIS BEING ALL MY HOPES AND DREAMS).The money will go towards the production of this book, as you can imagine itäó»s expensive and very time consuming. That said, Iäó»ve set the goal low, just to cover the costs associated with an initial batch of books. If we go over that goal, boy howdy would that be nice.

Check out my Patreon page for more details!ŒæWhere the shadows coalesce, Anubis takes form; the sleek muscle of fanged hound; the sleek eyed knowing of the man.ŒæWith cold stars for eyes, with cold stars for thoughts, he exists ever as a fulcrum between the scales; measuring, discerning.ŒæLike fleeting shadows across the sand, the lives of mortal man brushŒæpast his gaze and are gone. He measures each shadow in exacting perfection.Œæ He knows the bones of their lives, the immutable nature of all things.The sand hisses; dry whispers of secrets the living cannot discern. The sand gnaws at stones, at bones forgotten in the sand; at mortals who fade slowly from memory. He cloaks himself in the recursive impossibility of endings: all things end but endings.This portrait of Anubis, Discerning Gaze, is one of the first paintings Iäó»ve created towards an illustrated book of stories, themed around Egyptian Mythology.ŒæSince I was a child, Iäó»ve been fascinated and inspired by mythology, particularly, Egyptian Mythology. Mythology is full of old, old themes that are common to all of us, lessons of morality and questions of existential meaning, archetypes that re-appear across history and likey into future histories.Iäó»m thrilled to be working on creating a book and series of paintings that explore these themes! Offering these prints of Anubis is a way to kick off the project and create a chance to share this painting. Kickstarter's 'Make/100' event is the perfect opportunity!

If this campaign is successfully funded, then you will be charged the amount you decided to contribute.You will be charged by March 4th, but only if this campaign is fully funded.We want to create äóìThe Rogue Mangakaäó, a training course that will teach you in workshop-style how to draw Manga, using practical exercises and examples to make each step as easy as possible. We will avoid the lame tutorial style where not enough steps are covered and will go in-depth into the process to really transform you into a talented manga artist.ŒæBy the end of this training, you will have created your first original Manga.2DAnimation101Œæis an online school that has been helping beginners to create animations, with more than 50,000+ students over 186 countries. We believe in learning by involving the student in relevant projects that will spike their interest and keep them motivated.äóìTell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learnäó -Benjamin Franklin.We truly believe that being part of a project convinces your mind that you are doing something important and relevant and motivates you to take the next step.We are a couple of dreamers who love to help and who believe that anyone can develop talent. YES. ANYONE. Even if you were not born with the talent, we help you develop it.We have invested a ton of time in researching scientific proof that if you have a brain and a functional body, then you can learn to draw amazing things and turn them into animation.äóìAll our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue themäó -Walt Disney.I donäó»t believe in just having an idea and transform it into a product. No. I believe that ideas should be tested before bringing them into the market, and that is why we will be testing, making mistakes, improving the idea and testing again until we have the perfect formula to transform any beginner into a professional Manga Artist.As mentioned in the video, we are investing time and money in the research required.This research consists of learning the most about skill-acquisition and quick learning, so we can add all that science and knowledge into the course. All focused on developing the talent of drawing manga, for people who are not good at drawing.Part of this involves putting our ideas into practice and helping people who donäó»t have drawing skills to improve and draw decently, and then, scale the skill up to become amazing.We have found that people get results in the first 20 hours of our techniques because we are applying the concepts from Josh Kaufman, best selling author of äóìThe First 20 hoursäó.And I have personally found, after countless hours of 1-on-1 coaching, that students who learn to control emotions and self-awareness, improve and really become great artists, while students who don't know how to deal with frustration give up easily.That is why part of our research also involves applying the latest research and findings for positive psychology, happiness, and creativity, to accelerate the learning curve. Authors like: Csikszentmihalyi, Ed Catmull, Richard Williams, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Charles Duhigg, Daniel Kahneman, Mo Gawdat, Daniel Goleman, among many others.If you have no confidence and live in an environment that does not support creativity and artistic growth, you wonäó»t get very far, and you will blame your genes, your family, lack of resources, the economy or something else; but, in reality, when you learn how to manage your environment and your emotions, you can become unstoppable and learn anything you want.All of this emotional management, self-confidence, and esteem development will be included in this training, so you can listen to the audio lessons while you are practicing your drawing exercises daily.The goal is to have results in any student after the first 20 hours, and then, pump up the motivation until their reach the peak level of becoming a Mangaka (Manga Artist).Most of it will go into equipment, research, and legal fees. Here is a detailed distribution of all the budget:It all depends on when we will have discovered the process that guarantees results for any beginner with absolutely no drawing skills.We plan to have it on May or June 2018, after we have the budget ready, but it could take less or more than that.Any supporter will get news on our progress and discoveries. Those who pledge for the äóìEarly Beta Accessäó will be able to check the lessons we have released, before opening enrollment the course. (First lessons will be released on May, but not 100% of the course).No. Not at all.The purpose of this training is to help any dreamer out there, who always wanted to draw amazingly great anime characters, to become a manga artist even if they have NO SKILL at all.But in order to achieve that, we need to work on your mindset, because the biggest thing holding you back is your thoughts and emotions, the belief that you cannot achieve this. We will help you change that, with scientific proof and you will start getting the courage and motivation to become amazing in drawing manga.What are the requirements or equipment needed?At the very least, you need to invest in 4 things:If you can afford it, we recommend:"

Now I'm seeking your support to print a new edition of The Venetian Tarot deck in Mini version.The Venetian Tarot cards deck is the result of two years hard and exciting work of creation. Each card is hand painted here in my studio!ŒæThe deck has been created following Rider Waite traditions. Iconographic materials of the life in Venice in 16th-18th centuries were used when working at the Venetian Tarot. The main idea involves famous Venetian masks worn by all the arcanum characters in the deck. This allows appreciating the epoch and provides freedom for imagination promoting multilayer perception.ŒæThe deck has a conventional structure of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana. Minor Arcana classification by suits is also traditional and is represented by Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles.You can have a look at the making-process:The first edition of Venetian Tarot was already printed in October 2017! And it is very successful!You can see a lot of amazing reviews on the Venetian Tarot Facebook page:Œæhttps://www.facebook.com/venetiantarot/The deck is ordered a lot, but its price is high enough. The reason is a very long and hard technique of creation, complex pre-press process and very long printing with a large number of corrections due to the search of suitable colors of the cards.But NOW I would like to make the Venetian Tarot more attractive and available to all! With your help I would like to offer this beautiful deck for amazing price!I have the honor to present you:The Mini Venetian Tarot is a 78 cards deck gold gilded in the luxury book-shape magnetic closure box.Dimension of the mini cards: 1.9 x 3.5äó (52x92mm).The quality of the deck is exactly the same as the quality of the previous one!The differences are:Funding will cover the part of printing of 500 decks of the Mini Venetian Tarot, shipping, Kickstarter fees, etc.ŒæIf our funding goal is reached, I will place the order for the deck right after the campaign ends. I already have manufacturers lined up and all of the artwork is ready to print.ŒæOther ways you can help:ŒæThis project will only become a reality when more people become involved.ŒæPlease share this campaign with your friends!

246," A B O U T .What is Bokkel magazine, the first project of what we would love to be many more, and you may wonder What is it about? Well, it is a run of 100 magazines, each of its 40 pages includes games of the mind, stories and illustrations with a luxurious amount of detail. Bokkel Magazine is a return to the past, to those brochures and magazines that were sold in the old streets of England. Made with 100% recycled materials, we look for an eco-friendly and ecologic formula to share our art and above all to create fun and unusual games and stories that are entertaining. We were looking for an adequate size (A5) to be able to show off the great amount of detail in the ilustrations and to make it easier to interact with. Why is this version so special? There will only be 100 magazines signed, numbered and with a special secret, each magazine will contain a unique and special stamp. Take a look below.ŒæŒæŒæW H YŒæ ŒæK I C K S T A R T E R ?.It is difficult for a project of these characteristics to be possible without external support, and our desire is to obtain full funding so that it can come to light. Also in order to be able to do more projects. Our greatest dream would be, to be able to live from our work but for now we are more than happy that our work reaches the people who love what we do. That is why each contribution will be essential for us, a way to ensure that there are more projects of this magnitude and illusion. Thank you in advance for helping us with our project that has consumed us a lot of time and effort but that we present with great enthusiasm.ŒæW H A TŒæ ŒæI SŒæ ŒæE I Y I AŒæ ŒæE X A C T L Y ?.Eiyia is an artistic group born in 2017, formed by two artists, Emily Anne England (Enna Ylime) and Alvaro Lope Morales Quevedo (Alfher Lupus).

They seek with each project to get closer to what for them is ŒÂthe golden ageŒÂ, you could say the Victorian age with a medieval mixture. Their style is indefinable because they devote all their time and effort to create very different ideas, like this magazine, based on games, or figures, handmade toys or books and more.

Iäó»ll be choosing two bonus illustrations that will be sent to all $10+ backers along with any other rewards.*$900 (reached!) äóñ Greeting Cards! All $30+ backers will receive a special edition set of six assorted greeting cards featuring my artwork (Happy Birthday, Get Well Soon, Thinking of You, etc). Hi! Iäó»m Jenna. Iäó»m 11 years old and I like to draw almost all kinds of creatures, real or magical, (except humans). Iäó»ve been drawing custom themed cards and art prints for friends and family for many years featuring their pets and I really like that my art can make people smile. Hereäó»s a sample of some of my art from the last year. This year, I want to draw 100 custom dog portraits for dog owners and make a calendar featuring these portraits for the year 2019. I hope your dog will be one of them! Pup Prints are custom drawings of your dog that show off their unique personality. I love the way each dog is different and I like to draw these awesome animals to show off their inner character. ŒæI love to meet dogs and their owners around my neighborhood and over the past year, I started keeping an äóìencyclopediaäó of all the dogs I meet around town. Iäó»ve drawn over 50 dogs so far, but sadly, most of the time I donäó»t get a chance to show these drawings to the dog owners after theyäó»re done. That is how I got the idea for Pup Prints.  I thought other people might like to own a custom drawing of their best furry friend that shows off their dog with a little personality. Œæ Iäó»m going to take all the dogs I draw for this Kickstarter and include them on the front and back covers of the Pup Prints Calendar. On each month of the calendar, two dogs will be featured, the 24 ""pin up pups"" (see rewards for more details), along with their name and the city where they live.ŒæFor all personalized Pup Prints and Pin-Up Pup rewards, you'll send me one or two pictures of your dog along with a little biography about them such as their name, breed, and any special details you'd like to include (äóìchases her tailäó äóìLikes to bark at the vacuumäó etc) and I will create a hand drawn portrait of your dog inspired by your photo and description and send you a fine art print of your pupäó»s portrait along with your very own Pup Prints 2019 Desk Calendar.

My parents have always encouraged me to keep practicing and to try new art styles. I started out with craft paints and crayons and then moved to colored pencils. After awhile I started trying pen and ink and watercolor. Right now I like to draw using pencil and my Micron pens and then add color using my favorite Prismacolor pencils. ŒæThe funds I raise through this Kickstarter will go to pay for making the calendar, shipping rewards and some new art supplies for me to use to make these Pup Prints. I can't wait to äóìmeetäó your dog and create these custom drawings! "

251," Three years ago, I had an idea to make a book. That idea grew from a few illustrations that followed a Japanese folk song full narrative and the idea of printing the whole thing with letterpress. Because of Kickstarter, I made that book a reality.ŒæShortly after the campaign ended, I had an idea for another book. I've been working on that for the past two years.ŒæTamaThe idea of the story was simply about a little pebble, and how he wanted to be something he wasn't, like his friend Boulder. As I wrote, I did some research. Turns out in Japanese the word TamaishiŒæ(tah-mah-eee-she) is a word that means literally ""jewel stone"" and metaphorically, a hidden gem or ""diamond in the rough"".ŒæThat discovery helped me write the story about a little pebble and his path of finding out it's okay to be yourself äóî a journey from the heights of the valley where all the little things live to the depth of the Great Sea. Read the first chapter!So what are you making?Like before, I want to make three editions:This time around, the offset edition will include a second spot color. It's a small addition that will help add depth. The letterpress will be still be only one-color, but I'm going to create special limited edition will have handmade watercolor end sheets and a watercolor painting attached to the cover.ŒæŒæŒæFor now, I don't have a sample of this book, but to get an idea of what it will be, please listen to an excerpt from the Zsan audiobook.Wait, why not digital printing?ŒæDigital has its advantages. There are even options to print offset for cheaper than I've ever seen. But I have two motivations: 1) I've always preferred the look and feel uncoated stock, ink in the paper and printing with plates and things that are made by hand. 2) My printing, be it offset or letterpress, is done by artisans of their craft, in the US. It's archival, beautiful, and made by hand.Letterpress isŒætactile, subtle, and elegant, with the plates making a noticeable impression in the paper. You can see and feel the difference. Each letterpress impression is hand pulled by an artisan. Then the signatures are hand bound and glued and sewn together. The whole work is a piece of art.That's really what I want to make again.What about MAKE/100?I've added a special hand draw sketch of the characters to those that purchase the audiobook or the twofer - up to 100. This will be drawn on paper using colored pencils as the base and a micron to ink it.So how's this going to work?If successfully funded, I'll start making final steps towards production. The writing is done, and the artwork is nearly ready for plates. I'll probably make revisions to both for a few weeks as I start recording the audiobook (reading everything out loud always makes you change things slightly). I've been in communication with the same printers as before and they're both excited to begin.ŒæI'll begin more focused work on the audiobook äóî I've got some voice talent lined up, and lots of disparate musical ideas. I can begin recording all the narrator parts and the various characters.ŒæPlates will made for both printers and I'll begin acquiring all the necessary materials for production: bookcloth, end sheets, headbands, cover stock, etc. Those are all shipped directly to the bookbinders and printers for their use.Zsan was such a joy to behold in its final forms. I hope you'll join me in making this next book a reality as well.äóîŒçä‹¢Œæ"
252," For the past few years, I have taken to drawing friendly monsters in my sketchbooks as a productive non-computer hobby. In 2018, I made a resolution to make these monsters wall-worthy äóñ the Make 100 project on Kickstarter seemed like the perfect opportunity to get these monsters out of my sketchbooks on onto walls!ŒæThe funds I raise will go towards art supplies, frames, packaging costs, sticker printing, and something for me to sip on while I work.ŒæI generally don't plan out how each monster will look before I start creating it. Some of them have more human characteristics, like teeth, two eyes, and human noses, while others have strange, hose-like noses and a non-human number of eyes.ŒæThe monsters are always a non-skin color like red, blue, green, or orange. Most of the portraits are just the monster's head on a white background, but occasionally they appear in a meadow-like, blue-sky landscape.Traditionally, the monsters' medium has been colored pencil, but I would like to explore acrylic paints in this undertaking. Here is a monster painted in acrylic:Unlike colored pencil monsters, the acrylic monsters generally start as sketches. Here is an in-progress acrylic monster that began with a pencil sketch:ŒæThe 100 monsters will be 8x10 monster portraits, some on acrylic paint on board and some colored pencil on paper. I also have a digitized monster or two that will be available as stickers, and can also create some hand-drawn, adorable monster greeting cards for a lesser cost!These monsters are perfect artwork for your bathroom, your kid's room, or really any room!Œæ"

However, I also want to involve the gaming and art community in that!ŒæAll characters designs will be SFW ( safe for work) and be completed in the style of pictures shown.I will be doing the sketches with pen, pencil, and white gel pens on toned paper. I already have most of these supplies, but this project will require a good amount of time to complete.ŒæFunds raised will pay for time, materials, and future education.ŒæThis will be for the Make 100 challenge!"

255," Hi! My name is Jess and I am an artist and sculptor based in Surrey. I have loved art since a very young age but left it behind to pursue a career in ecology after graduating with a degree in Environmental Geography. However, working as an ecologist and volunteering with wildlife inspired me to start making wildlife related art and in 2013 'Silverpasta Crafts' was born.ŒæWith my craft business about to turn 5 years old, I have decided to go back to my roots and launch an illustration project. Last year I bought myself a drawing tablet which allows me to create digital illustrations which can be printed on a variety of different objects! For this project I am focusing on getting 100 tea towels printed, showcasing three different designs I have been working on.ŒæŒæŒæŒæAs British wildlife is my biggest inspiration, I have decided to create a 'British birds', 'British mammals' and 'British insects' design.ŒæMy tea towels are made from high quality 8oz 100% cotton with Half Panama weave, measure 74 x 47cm and are hemmed on four sides. They are manufactured in the UK. I have now received all three sample tea towels and have made some small adjustments, you can see the final designs in the image above.To help fund my campaign I have created some rewards which will be sent out to anyone who pledges! Obviously the most important reward is the tea towels themselves, which you have the choice of pledging for one, or a set of all three designs!I will also be having some A6 notebooks printed, which can also be chosen as single notebooks or a pack of all three designs. They will be printed on 300gsm white recycled card and will have 48 plain pages inside.As well as these awesome rewards, I will also send three postcards (one of each design) and a sheet of A6 vinyl stickers with my favourite illustrations featured.If these are not exciting enough, I will also be offering custom illustrations of any wildlife in the world (excluding domestic pets!) which will be delivered as unframed A5 prints.Since I have reached my original target, I am in the process of adding several stretch goals!Œ£1,100 (REACHED!)Œæ- 100 coasters! These are now available to add to your existing pledge - check the update section for details! Below are the confirmed designs for the coasters, which you can choose from when I send out the surveys at the end of the project.

256," Hi! I'm Nadia, a watercolor artist and owner of the Etsy shop AriadelSole. My 4 year old daughter, Aria, LOVES dinosaurs.Œæ She really loves T-Rex.Œæ She also loves the color pink, and if she could create a monochromatic pink world around her, she absolutely would.Œæ So naturally, she requested that I paint her a pink T-Rex.Œæ At that moment T-Regina was born.Œæ Aria and I are fans of enamel pins and patches and thought that T-Regina would make an awesome pin that we could share with others.Œæ But we need your help to make this possible.ŒæI am hoping to make 100 soft enamel pins and 100 backing cards for the pins.

257," ŒæHi!Œæ I'm Sarah Mason.Œæ I am a watercolour, ink and pencil artist residing in the UK.Œæ My passion lies within nature and animals and my art likes to reflect the delicate, whimsical and organic themes that wildlife flourishes and blooms with.ŒæI am most known for my delicate art that blends strong traditional techniques with contemporary themes.Œæ My subjects are often animals and floral themes, incorporating the two together to create beautiful ink and colour illustrations.ŒæYou can find me here:Originals and PrintsŒæPortfolioPatreonFacebookTwitterThis small project brings together those two themes in a very personal and beautiful way.ŒæLast year, a piece became very close to my heart and also became the face of my website and social media.  Flora and Fauna is a special design that was brought to life by a combination of my love of skulls, animals and floral themes - in due time, this half face design was born.  It features the colourful, vibrancy of a fox, the raw, beautiful skull is revealed underneath, laying on a bed of delicate flowers.  The design is everything I stand for, delicate, colourful and raw.The pin will be approximately 38mm (though it could be larger, this is currently under review), with an antique gold plating and a rubber clutch.  The pin will be part of the #Make100 Kickstarter campaign that runs throughout January.The pin will be provided with it's very own backer card, detailed with floral themes and will be hand signed and numbered - this pin is a limited run of 100 only.NEW OPEN EDITION PIN AVAILABLEAs over half of the limited edition pins have sold out in less than 24 hours - I have decided to add an open edition pin badge as well.Œæ The size and clutch remain the same however this is not a limited edition version and the colouring, plating and backing card will be slightly different as well as it not being signed and numbered.ŒæThese pins are available at a discounted rate, and will be available on Etsy after the campaign for a higher amount.ŒæThis is not my first rodeo of a Kickstarter.  Last year I released a small Kickstarter which featured special postcards and greetings cards.  The goals were simple and production ran smoothly.  The total of backers and pledged amount hit over 300% of my listed goal and was extremely successful. ABOUT THE TIERSäó†ŒæThere will be a number of simple tiers available for the #Make100 Flora and Fauna pin badge Kickstarter.  This will include the following:äó†Œæ-Downloadable colouring pages.Œæ-The Pin Badge (Limited to 100).-4 Black and White A5 print set.-Original inked artwork tiers.äó†ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ ŒæŒæŒæI plan to run some stretch goals which will include: Œæ-Additional gold foiled finished mini print of one of my Beast in Blossom designs  -8x8cm Black and White sew on patch (Kickstarter Exclusive)Once these two goals have been hit, I will consider other rewards, maybe an additional pin? *hint hint*ŒæFor full transparency on the final goal number for this project, I have broken it down into four categories.  The first being the most obvious part of the funds - the product. Both the pins and the prints will be made my Awesome Merchandise in the UK.Œæ Their quality is outstanding and if you were a part of my previous project, you will know that my previous pin ""Coil"" was a high standard and was very beautiful!The largest part of the funding goal is actually shipping.  Which is the most difficult part to calculate and predict.  I have spent a lot of my time weighing the pins I currently have and using the Royal Mail price finder tool to give me a quote.Œæ The shipping altogether comes to about 40% of the funding goal. Œæ10% of the funding accounts for Kickstarter and Credit Card fees which usually equate to that number (5% for Kickstarter fees and 3-5% for Credit Card fees.)ŒæThe last 15% is a cushion for any emergencies or issues that may happen, such as products and items becoming damaged or lost in transit that will need replacing.I would like to personally thank all those who follow me, support me on Patreon and who backed my previous Kickstarter as well as this project - you have all given me the boost I need to keep going with my art projects, including this pin!Please note that I am not responsible for any customs fees or charges that may be encountered in your Country once the product has been shipped.  EU, US and Aus customers will pay no customs charges."

One Titan, Prometheus, loved playing with clay and one day he made a lot of small humans from the wet earth. Zeus was taken with the figures so much so he breathed life into them.  At first, the humans worshipped Zeus. But Prometheus was a mischievous soul and he convinced the humans to play a prank on Zeus. The prank was a success. Yet Zeusäó»s pride was hurt and in his anger he took fire away from the earth. ŒæCold and hungry, the humans complained to Prometheus. Feeling responsible, Prometheus snuck up to the sky and stole a piece of the sun. Prometheusäó» gift brought fire back to the earth, and the humans rejoiced.ŒæZeus, however, punished Prometheus harshly. Chaining Prometheus to a big rock, Zeus left him to have his liver eaten every day by a big eagle. Yet Prometheusäó» immortality meant he could never die. Each night his liver regrew and each day he was forced to relive his torment as the bird returned.ŒæPrometheus was eventually freed by Herakles but before that, determined to punish his cousin further. Zeus ordered Hephaestus and Athena to create a woman, Pandora, äó†and had all the other gods give her gifts of both blessings and curses. Then, Zeus offered Pandora to Prometheusäó» younger brother, Epimetheus.ŒæYoung and in love, Epimetheus took Pandora as a bride despite his brotheräó»s warnings. On their wedding day, Zeus gave Pandora a sealed jar as a present. Unable to stop her curiosity, Pandora opened the jar released a swarm of evil spirits that would forever plague and curse mankind. Only Elpis (hope) remained inside, a single blessing to ease humanityäó»s suffering.ŒæŒæThe evil spirits slowly took the forms of monsters and bad energy thatäó† äó†causedäó† äó†the humanäó»s to suffer. Pandora, feeling responsible for the misery she unwittingly caused, made a deal with Elpis. She and Epimetheus would sacrifice their long lives and immortality to give Elpis strength to help the humans. Elpis agreed on the condition that she would gift their descendants with the ability to trap the evil spirits back into the jar and she would stay with them until their mission was accomplished.ŒæThus, the Pangakos family came to be, and to this day they seek to seal Pandoraäó»s box once and for all....ŒæWhat do you get?Œæ$1 - Access to our blog and updates about the Kickstarter!Œæ$10 - An adorable sticker sheet with 6 baby monsters!ŒæŒæ15$ - A digital pdf of the book!Œæ20$ - A physical copy of the book35$ - A physical copy of the book and One mini print (6x9)40$ - 2 physical copies of the book and 2 sticker sheets!Œæ50$ - A physical copy of the book and All the mini prints (6x9)ŒæWho are We?ŒæThe Writer and DesignerKara Leopard is the creator of the webcomic Mr.Hare & Mr.Bear as well as the writer of Brooke St. with artist Alex Wang.

Sortir de ma zone de confort serait l'expression approprií©e.En 2017, j'ai donc dí©cidí© de faire deux choses: Une exposition consacrí©e íæ un projet lancí© en 2013 lors de mon arriví©e au Quí©bec ainsi que la crí©ation d'une infolettre, la PAUSE photo.Ces deux aventures m'ont appris plusieurs choses :ParallíÂlement íæ ces rí©flexions, j'ai eu l'occasion de dí©velopper un profond attachement au livre photo, notamment sous läó»impulsion de l'excellent travail du PHOTOBOOK CLUB - Montrí©al, dans le cadre duquel jäó»ai pris beaucoup de plaisir dí©couvrir le medium.Vous me voyez venir...?ŒæEn fait pas un livre mais bien deux...Mon projet,ŒæDiptyque MTL est construit en deux opus ayant pour fil conducteur mon amour pour la photo de rue.ŒæL'importance des choses,le livre ICe livre est en noir et blanc, 15 cm x 22 cm.ŒæL'ouvrage devrait faire approximativement soixante-dix pages. J'en suis rendu íæ 80% en terme de design, graphisme et mise en page. Je devrais vous donner des nouvelles d'ici peu pour le premier prototype !ŒæSa sortie est prí©vue pour le 24 mars 2018.L'envoi des livres se fera donc dans le courant du mois d'avril.ŒæPouf, pouf, pouf, passons au deuxiíÂme opus.La couleur de la marche, le livre IIBeaucoup de choses sont encore íæ dí©velopper pour ce deuxiíÂme ouvrage. J'ai tout le matí©riel et suis en train de le structurer. C'est un travail intí©ressant car il s'agit maintenant de trouver les meilleures rí©sonances possible entre les images.Voici un petit aperí_u d'extraits du livre.ŒæSa sortie est prí©vue pour juin 2018. L'envoi des livres se fera donc dans le courant du mois de juillet.Œæ------ Mais alors pourquoi as-tu besoin de financement  ?Œæ ------C'est une excellente question! :)Je me fixe deux objectifs:Un premier palier íæ 2 200 $ qui me permet de garantir la production du premier livre íæ 40 exemplaires.Un deuxiíÂme palier íæ 4 000$ qui me permet de garantir la production du premier et du deuxiíÂme livre íæ 40 exemplaires.Produire un livre, c'est oní©reux ! ll faut payer les prototypes, l'impression des pages, les couvertures et la reliure. Le montant de financement correspond íæ la production des prototypes + 40 livres I et 40 livres II + les frais de Kickstarter (8%) + les frais de crí©ation des contributions.J'aimerais í©galement vous expliquer en quoi cette collecte me permet d'aller plus loin dans ce projet qui me tient íæ cñur.Un grand merci pour votre aide et n'hí©sitez surtout pas íæ partager par tout les moyens possibles ce projet !EtienneŒæ"
262," We want to help our local artist community while at the same time getting you a ridiculously awesome limited offset print.ŒæAbout the Project:This project is called: Category 4 and we are making limited art prints because we want to help Puerto Rico's creative scene after hurricane Marí_a. We selected 2 local artists to create an original print to help gather resources for marginalized groups and the art community.Hurricane Marí_a ravaged Puerto Rico leaving an already crumbled economy in worst shape. It's been months since the hurricane passed and art spaces, artists and creative projects now face the threat of disappearing. After two hurricanes and economic struggles we are still here and will keep on fighting.By getting these unique prints, you will help artists in Puerto Rico get back on track with their creative and cultural projects.ŒæAbout the prints:ŒæThe print will be 18 x 24 inches. This series is an edition of 50. Offset printed on Strathmore (Mohawk) Cover 80 lb. Signed and numbered, comes with a Certificate of Authenticity from the artists and Contrabando. Each print will help Puerto Rico's creative community.

264," My name is Julia Spiri. I work as a freelance artist, and painting is my full-time job.I have a bacheloräó»s degree in Fine Arts. For many years I have painted portraits, and illustrations, I illustrated a range of coloring books and childrenäó»s story books. I have been painting for all my life.ŒæI live near Barcelona in Spain. My style is influenced by Pop surrealism and Whimsical, Fantasy Art.In this coloring book you will find lots of whimsical, magical characters from a gentle world of fantasy. There are 50 images to color, and images are printed on a single side of each page. Creating so many characters for this book was a very long process, but so much fun. I drew the images using a combination of traditional and digital pencil. Each of my characters is unique, different from the other and I have drawn them with a lot of love. I received my first offset copies of book! I'm soooo happy with results! The books have come out as I wanted!! Woho! It's so exciting to have a books in my hands!Œæ I have created these 3 images purely for The Whimsical Wonders book. I will not sell these images in my other shops. And as a token of gratitude my backers will also receive these 3 exclusive images in PDF file for digital downloand.When I was preparing this book, I wanted to to offer you the best of me: not only my best drawings, but also to create for you a high quality book with heavy weight paper, so that you can have an enjoyable, unforgettable coloring experience. I have tried different types of papers from several publishing companies, until finally I found premium quality paper that surpasses my expectations. It's the best paper in the market for coloring books.ŒæŒæThis high quality heavy weight paper is 118 Ib (170g) is a light cream color, and it is a delight to color in. I will strengthen the book with smyth sewing, and will add perforated pages. I already have my proof copy of the book and I have passed the pre-press approval and now the book is ready to be printed. Offset printing is the highest quality book printing available.If you page through a Smyth-sewn book, you can see the thread stitches in the center fold of each signature. Smyth-sewn binding is associated with durability and quality, and is able to stand up to years of wear and tear. This binding method is ideal for books since the pages lay flat.For that reason your book will not be broken when you use it, and The Sheets Will Not Come Off in Your Book!Whimsical Wonders: The Artistäó»s Edition will be print in the United States of America, in a factory that has a lot of experience in printing coloring books. That's why the books will be printed quickly and will not be long in arriving.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæStretch Goals are a great way to say thank you! If we go over our funding costs, I'll add some extra goodies!3,500ä‰å -ŒæYou will receive ""Lulu Cat Girl"" color image (8.5""x11"") in PDF file for digital download.ŒæACHIEVED!5,000ä‰åŒæ -ŒæI will draw new black&white image in exclusive for backers only and I will add it in PDF file for digital download.Why Kickstarter?ŒæI'm really excited to be directly involved in getting my books out to folks!ŒæWhen will you receive your book?

Iäó»ve been creating art for 12 years now and love exhibiting my creations at various conventions in the midwest, and Iäó»m always looking to travel to new shows! Something Iäó»ve been passionate about for a really long time is Monster Girls. I have a long-standing obsession with monster girls since I was young, so I figured itäó»s time to show these femme fatales the limelight with a new exciting pin collection.The initial goal of my Kickstarter is $600- this will cover 100 pieces each of 3 designs Iäó»ve made. (Plus fees, shipping, packaging, and all that other fun stuff). This kickstarter has EIGHT stretch goals, there are 19 designs that will total around 1400 pins. Each pin is going to be between 1.2äó & 2äó in size, and all will be gold plated with soft enamel. The skull pins will have one rubber clutch on the back, the 18 other designs will each have two rubber clutches on the back.This project has been in the works since early November of 2017. The first three pins were chosen in collaboration with my fans, and Iäó»m happyŒæto reveal the designs for the initial funding goal:For the first three designs, two of them are 1.5äó large and the other is 1.8äó.

271," ABOUT THE ARTISTAs a non-native, my passion for textures was born out of a desire to look at the world in my own unique way; a way that would fill my photo album with typical tourist snaps that had already been taken a thousand times before meäó_So I started taking charcoal rubbings, or as I like to call them 'touches'.ŒæI believe these simple reliefs are fingerprints of actual tactile surfaces around us, and whilst, at first they might seem quite abstract, they offer a sense of scale and allow you to focus on the intricate details that are often overlooked. My toolkit consists of a variety of soft black charcoals and Chinese Mulberry PI paper.ŒæMy commissions have taken me from the United Kingdom to Barbados and throughout the United States.ŒæKICKSTARTER 100So this is where my Kickstarter 100 project starts. I would like to create 100 touches,Œæpersonalized with your first initial a charcoal relief rubbing from New York City and surrounding boroughs.Each touch will be createdŒæusing a single, bespoke charcoal letter, made to order. The accompanying rubbing will depict one of New York's lesser-known sites (like the ones you see above). Simply let me know your choice of letter and I will find it. With your donation, you will receive a bespoke, signed 9.5"" x 7.5"" charcoal rubbing, (unframed). Included withinŒæyour packet will be a 4"" x 4"" photo (on Mohawk Superfine Eggshell, 120lb card) of the work in progress.ŒæType ExperimentsHere are a couple of experiments I took from Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I will be looking to explore touristŒæspots and stunning monuments of New York with more elaborateŒætype.ŒæŒæIf you would like to see more of my work please have a look at my Website and Instagram:Website: www.touchuponstudios.comInstagram:Œæ@touchupon"
272," Hi! I am Catalina, a visual artist who LOVES abstracting people and sees colors everywhere. My most recent solo show, LUDO (lat. äóìplayäó), is now on view in STURM UND DRANG GALERIE, in Austria.ŒæŒæŒæŒæI have received such a positive feedback on this colorful ludic series from so many people and because I am fascinated with faces and I analyze facial features since I can remember, I have created äóìLudo Profileäó.For me, painting is playing. I have discovered this through my son and his evolution from a nursing baby to a toddler. He inspired LUDO project and he continues to inspire me in life in everything I do. He does it on two aspects: physically, by having my house full of colorful toys and seeing colors wherever I step, and emotionally, by being filled with such love and joy that I receive from him, which somehow, on an emotional level, translates into colors too. I just cannot look at the world the same way as before his arrival. Therefore, for this new project, I decided to stick with the name äóìLudoäó, that means äóìplayäó in Latin, because it is authentic, represents my reality as it is, and is something that totally defines my work.This new projectäó»s purpose is to abstract as many profile portraits as possible in order to show and emphasize the uniqueness and individuality of each and every one of us.ŒæLooking at somebody in a perfect profile angle you will notice an outline made of unique angles, distances and proportions, parameters who makes somebody recognizible out of a million other identities. This is much easier to see when you let the details go and focus on the overall shape.Œæ In äóìLudo Profileäó I am using the flat form to emphasize this uniqueness inside all of us and the color to show emotions, to depict the spirit and the personality of the individual.ŒæŒæIf you decide to be part of äóìLudo Profileäó, these are the steps we take together:1. It all starts with your photograph. You chose a profile picture (or pictures) that you would like me to paint. We should establish from the start if you prefer a digital painting or a hand-made acrylic on canvas painting.The picture should be (ideally) a perfect profile-angle portrait, like below:Note: I am open to talk to you about other portrait angles and other types of composition too.2. After this, I will ask you short questions about the person(s) in the photograph, questions that will help me create a painting with a personal impact. Now you can tell me any particularities you want me to include in the painting: favorite colors, favorite accessoires, etc. You may also include text: a personal quote, a date, something personal or something general, simple words or full sentences.3. Now your painting is in process and you will receive the high resolution file as soon as I finish the work. If you opted for a pshysical work (print or hand-made painting), this will follow by post immediately. I will deliver the works chronologically, starting with May and ending around October, depending on the number of comissions.That's it! Your profile picture is now part of the äóìLudo Profileäó and added to the e-book too!ŒæPlease spread the news and this way you'll help me continuing doing what I love!

279," Hi, my name is Alexandra but you can call me Ali. I have been drawing since before I can remember. The earliest memory I have of drawing is when I tried to draw a person for a good hour. I didn't realize there was an eraser at the end of the pencil so every time I screwed up I threw away a piece of paper. I've learned a bit since then. :)Drawing and art in general are what I live for. I love sketching with all my heart and I want to share my drawings with the world. I've watched and read about many Kickstarter success stories and naturally wanted to try one myself. I was inspired, however my fears of failure kept me from starting a project. After years of watching, I figured I needed to face my fear and take a risk. Sure, the project may not get funded but if I never try I'll never know!Speaking of funding, all money made through this project will go towards building awareness for me as an artist. The bulk of any proceeds will be used for entrance fees to art fairs or shows. This will allow me to participate in larger shows and help bring my art to new areas that I wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.ŒæAnother portion will go towards purchasing small ads with Etsy and Facebook. These ads have the ability to reach farther than I could on my own, and will hopefully catch the interest of potential clients. Any remaining proceeds will be used to purchase art supplies to continue my work.The lower tiers will receive a random drawing done with pencil. Middle tiers have perks added such as a splash of color, personalized drawing, or the use of a different medium (colored pencil, water colors, pencil, ink/marker). In the higher tiers you will have a combination of those items available. Every drawing no matter what tier it's in will be sprayed with a protective finish to avoid any smudging.I enjoy working with various mediums and styles. Below you will see some drawings that I have done in watercolor pencils, color pencils, ink/marker, and pencil.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæIf you'd like to see more of my work you can find me on Instagram (@alexandra_art_design) as well as Facebook (Alexandra Art+Design). I look forward to creating some art for you!"
280," Essentially, a compendium of philosophies on human existence, short stories and illustrations straight from my neurosis, as much as I can fit into a short novel, without being overwhelming. I want to explore human angst, the question of how an why we are here, and provide a lucid argument for the intellectuality of christianity without preaching. My goal is to make it interesting and readable, and to revive conversationalism on a common level. I am almost finished the book, this money will help me on the last leg which I cannot fund myself. I'm asking only what I absolutely need because I would feel fraudulent otherwise. Thank you to anyone who donates! I hope to have a wonderful product for you! And to be clear, I do NOT have a college degree! I am self educated. I hope that doesn't discount me as an knowledgable person in your eyes. And yes I should have shaved for the video I apologize! And I hope to be finished by the end of march! I cant give any gaurantees that it will be picked up by a publisher, but if not I will find out how to publish it myself and make it available to everyone!"
281," äÖÊ Hello! This campaign is totally different from my prior one, and everything else I have planned for this year. The Cosmos Magi Squad (Î¬ˆÎ¬»Ü€_Ü‰¬___) is a passion project through and through. Make sure to read all the way through to catch up on the current lore behind these accessories, as well!äÖÊThe idea behind the Squad is to essentially write yourself into the universe! Aside from some mild lore and character designs, there is no story yet, because that is for you to decide!ŒæThe majority of pledges come with character design postcards, for you to draw and describe your character for the Squad. As an uchuu kei inspired project universe, the Uchuu Magi Squad is based out of a paw-shaped planet, and operates on the promise to protect all cosmic cuties of the universe! The merch included in the goal are essentially membership into our own Earth based Squad - having one of these items on or with you insures you are always part of the team to uphold justice here as well. Besides that fact, they will also be quite gorgeous once produced, if I do say so myself! ;)ŒæŒæMost of the merch is based on the Squad uniforms, and accessories loved and used by the Squad leader I have designed. Their design is secret until the campaign is over; I want to encourage everyone to make characters without any influence from their gender or body type!ŒæThe wand is their weapon, with the hat being a conjuring vessal for their magic. The stuffed cat assistant (one of the sticker designs) was brought to life to assist the Squad via that very hat!ä»çThe logo specific to the Squad is the heart Saturn with stars, so make sure to include it in your designs! Every single character design card will be pre-approved with a Squad logo stamp before shipment - as long as your art is not too raunchy or explicit, you are already approved to enter your OC in the Squad!ä»çWith your passion, I would like to welcome all of you to this project, to make a story together! I would love for our characters to fight the baddies and monsters they come up against, to keep the Cosmos safe. While the design cards are limited to Squad members and pets, you are free to design villains and monsters as well! Everyone who tags me on social media or who messages me post-project with their designs will get featured on my pages.ŒæäÖÊäÖÊäÖÊCURRENT LOREäÖÊäÖÊäÖÊThe Cosmos Magi Squad, pronounced ""Uchuu Mahgee Tai"" from the Kanji writing, was founded when the planet of Lí_pchu realized that despite its population being at peace, there is a lot of upset in the universe.ŒæIt founded the organization on the premise that anyone can be a silent member to show support locally to Lí_pchu projects and decisions made by the population, but the official squad members travel the planet extensively, as well as going into outerspace, to explore the resources and observe peacefully, and resolve conflicts between neighboring civilizations!ŒæOften their work involves chasing space dragons away from small elfen civilizations, as they enjoy warm areas on their planet, and the sea dragons like to bask and aggressively claim territory, which blocks out their sunlight. Currently, the Squad is looking into a series of strange letters that have been dropped off at their headquarters, in a language they have not yet encountered...ŒæŒæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ äÖÊäÖÊäÖÊThis witch's hat pin is based on the summoning hat my OC Squad Leader wears! It is based on magician's tophats, but altered to match traditional witchy fashion. This hat is where the leader Œæconjures their spells from that involve a physical summoning.This pin is based on their weapon! Every squad member has their own weapon that suits their abilities. Being the leader, this wand has been fashioned based on the Squad logo, and is how they conjure up any powers.ŒæThis is actually the ""belt"" to the leader's outfit! The center bow's gem emits a mysterious light, and has been passed down for generations. The leader's mother passed it on after she officially retired and joined the elder's council.ŒæŒæThis kitty, Emerald or ""Rally"" for short, was animated through the hat! Before their first mission, the leader decided the Squad advisor could use some help, and conjured up this sassy kitty.ŒæThe logo has been fashioned based on Lí_pchu's rings, and the idea that they are striving to peacefully protect interspecies friendships and relations through the cosmos. Therefore, a heart was swapped out with the planet's physical shape!If you'd like a mishmash of items that isn't offered in the pledge tiers, here are the amounts to add to your pledge if you would like any extra of the following:Holo vinyl stickers - Œæ$5/eachMembership design cards - $2/eachRainbow metal pins - $15/eachŒæPatches - $10/eachShop logo stickers are freebies, but limited!If you add on a ton of *pins*, please tack on some extra for shipping! Not a whole lot, it's about 1oz per 2 packaged pins.Œæäó¢8% of cost from goal goes towards Kickstarter feesäó¢Around 72% goes to the products themselves, and the costs to have them shipped to meäó¢The remaining costs go towards shipping and handling costs toward backers worldwide, which includes new packaging supplies!äó¢There is a small buffer included in base goal cost to insure everything can still be afforded even if a few payments are cancelled or rejected past funding period.ŒæAll pledge amounts from the fully funded project should be to my account by March 10th, at hopefully the latest. Immediately, payment for the pins will be submitted, stickers will be ordered, and patches will begin production!ŒæOnce I get confirmation that all areŒæ in production, I will submit the much smaller payment for the character design cards, as they have a much shorter production time. Every one of the initial 3 larger orders has an approximately 2-3 week production-to-door timeline, and therefore should all be in my hands by the end of March.ŒæWith all of the above in mind, everything should be able to be shipped to backersŒæ by/within the first week of April!Project updates post funding period will be posted when payments have been submitted, when I have sample photos of pins and patches, and if any issues come along. I will also of course let you know when things arrive, how they look, and when I am shipping orders out!Depending on arrival times, I may be able to ship some orders out ahead of time, if they only consist of what arrives in stock first.Œæ[¥Ë_LOCKED¥Ë_] Unlocked at $2006 !

Anyone who wears the logo at the time is considered an honorary member, and may attend Squad meetings and vote on congressional decisions. No one is forced to at any time, but the support is always appreciated!Currently, 2 more patches are planned as final stretch goal! They are the Squad's nurse, and her healing wand.

283," This is your chance to get a custom art portrait made of yourself, someone you love, a mentor, or an inspiration. This is not screen printing, but painting using stencils and pressurized paint. Send me an image you'd like me to immortalize and you'll get a print, or get a t-shirt that has been painted by me, or a canvas that has been painted by me.This project started when I was in high school, running for class president, needing to make campaign materials. My first ever stencil was a picture of my face with the text ""Vote Bush."" I won the election, and every year since I've been making bespoke stencils and t-shirts. That was 12 years ago.This is the first time I'm opening to everyone. This project is an opportunity to get a personal portrait to memorialize any moment or memory. Own something that no one else will have, and wear it or present it proudly.I enjoy the stencil as an art form because of the crisp lines. With a stencil I can make complex and intricate shapes that have extremely fine features and lines. Combine that with the ability to multiply the design over and over again on a variety of canvas, and the art form itself builds a realm for itself.ŒæThe history of graffiti and street art also brings a lot to the table when you use a stencil. In terms of democratized art and disruption are fundamental to the media.The last run of shirts I made was 50 shirts for an exhibit at the Stanford d.school called ""The Aesthetics of Fame."" These shirts were a conversation about what fame is and means and is reflected. If the 100 designs are created for this Make100 project it will be my biggest run ever."

285," DISCLAIMER: There's no swearing.This is a project based in the passion that I have for real and made up toys and all of the characters that you can think of when you limit yourself to things that could be toys.ŒæYou'd think that after how many years of toys existing and the fact that there are so many people in the world that we'd have reached complete saturation of toys and there would nothing new to think of, this of course isn't the case and luckily for all of us there's always something new whether it be something as amazing as a skateboarding Velociraptor or as mundane as a bus driver.ŒæŒæThe Idea to make this into a Zine made perfect sense to me as it allows for multiple drawings to be compiled into a relatively small and easy to share medium which means I can share as many drawing as possible without having to produce expensive prints which I'd have to sell at a higher price. I want everyone to feel the same childlike joy I feel when drawing these toys and so want to keep it as cheap as possible.ŒæThe Zine itself will be 30 pages minimum (with more pages if there's time) with the inner pages being black and white and the front cover being colour. The front cover will be made as the same paper as the inner pages which will be a minimum of 160gsm but I am aiming for thicker paper if I can get it printed double sided and still keep a good finish without it being to thick.If you've read this far then you may be wondering why I keep calling them ""Toys"" when they'reŒæclearly ""Figures"" and in all honesty its no other reason than the fact that I prefer the word toys....Thanks for taking to time to look over this project.Kind RegardsVHS REX"

289," Hi, I'm Heather, and I've been a mixed media artist, costumer and crafter my entire adult life. I've also been a Tarot deck lover and collector for decades. As an artist, it has long been a dream of mine to design a deck. And I've now decided to bring that idea to life!At the 2017 Burning Man event, I was gifted a Tarot card by one of my camp-mates. The card I randomly pulled from the deck was The Tower, symbolizing something overthrown to begin anew. My twin sister, who was camping with me, casually asked if I ever did anything with the tarot  drawings I had once started. The card and the question became seeds, my experience at Burning Man was the catalyst. Like lightning, inspiration struck. Back from Burning Man, I began to draw the Playa Flame Tarot.ŒæThe deck is based on traditional tarot themes and images, but also reflects my experiences with the people, art and culture of Burning Man.ŒæI sketched like a madwoman for three months and completed all the preliminary drawings for the 78 card tarot deck.  Then I started painting, transferring the line work to watercolor paper, and hand-painting the images. I will soon complete all the final artwork, within a month, and be ready to have the cards printed.ŒæIn alignment with the Burning Man principle of Gifting, I plan to print at least 40 decksŒæ of the Playa Flame Tarot to give away at Burning Man 2018. Gifting is a vital part of Burning Man culture, and a key objective to this project.The deck will not be offered for sale (supporting the BM principle of Decommodification); the only way to get a deck will be by being gifted one or by contributing to the project here on Kickstarter so that you get one as a reward. ŒæIn backing the Playa Flame Tarot, you gift yourself and others.ŒæAll the monies pledged will go toward printing gifting decks, plus printing and shipping for any additional decks and cards needed to fulfill backers' rewards, and to cover fees here at Kickstarter. I have pre-invested art materials, paper and paints, time and creative effort it, and I'll continue until the Playa Flame Tarot is a reality.To reflect more of the Burning Man theme, I have made some changes from the traditional cards. The tarot suits have been changed from Pentacles, Wands, Swords, and Cups to Dust, Flames, Aerials and Waters. I've also altered a few of the titles of cards in the Major Arcana. For instance, the Chariot becomes ""Art Car"",Œæ the Hierophant becomes ""Ranger"", and the Tower becomes ""Burn"".Here are a few samples of the preliminary sketches and finished paintings for this project.  More of the project artwork may be viewed on my blog.Œæhttp://e-phemerart.blogspot.comŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæSample cards are printed tarot size, 2.75 x 4.75 on 300 gsm smooth card stock.

291," With the help of Kickstarter, and some very lovely backers, I was recently able to realise the dream of creating my very first enamel pin. So, fresh from the success of my first project I've been inspired to have another crack at it.2018 marks 100 years since the first women in the UK won the right to vote. As a passionate voter myself, I wanted to create a new pin to mark the occasion. Where better to draw inspiration than from the powerful legacy of The Suffragettes, after all I wouldn't be able to make a single mark on any ballot paper without their courageous campaigning.The PinFor my design, I've particularly drawn on the iconic purple, green and white Suffragette colour palette, which was often also reflected in the jewellery they wore at the time. Throughout history weäó»ve seen how important it is to speak up to effect change. So when you may be feeling frustrated and overwhelmed with the state of things, I hope this pin can help pick you back up and encourage you to keep making your mark. Just a small X in a box can be a powerful tool!If I exceed all my expectations and reach an amazing Œ£400 I will unlock another pin design for my fab backers to choose from. ŒæŒæThe Pin (if unlocked)If I manage to go and completely smash all my goals, after picking my jaw up off the floor, I will look at adding even more exciting stretch goals.NEW STRETCH GOAL!ŒæThe Patch (if unlocked)I've put my thinking cap on to come up with a brand new stretch goal for the campaign.

292," Hey everyone, my name is Michelle (also known as LabradoriteWolf on Facebook, Instagram and Deviantart) and I recently graduated as a biologist. While I'm in the middle of figuring out what my next career step should be, I realized now is the time to explore my creative side a bit more. I've always wanted to see my designs come to life in a physical form, something you can hold, or wear.ŒæEnter the enamel pin! They are small, easy to fly across the ocean and relatively inexpensive to make. The only trouble is you have to manufacture them in large batches, which is quite tough when you have no budget to take risks. Therefore, I decided to give the project a shot here on kickstarter, and that's where you come in.ŒæMy first pin design features a timber wolf, a creature that's linked to many myths and stories. For centuries, the wolf has been seen as evil, a bad omen, while in more recent years, it has been put in a more positive light. With these pins I hope to emphasize that the wolf is not an animal to fear, but to admire.ŒæThe pin design comes in different color variations, which I matched to the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. I chose this specific celestial theme, as wolves are often tied to celestial bodies in myths.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæWith this money I will be able to manufacture the Sun and the Stars variation of the timber wolf enamel pin, as the same mold can be reused for different colors when the same plating is used (gold in this case).ŒæOnce this goal is reached, I will be able to manufacture the Moon variation of the pin as well!ŒæA fourth design will be unlocked!ŒæA fifth design will be unlocked!A sixth design will be unlocked!Once the project is successfully funded, you get the chance to choose from the available, unlocked designs. Which designs are available will depend on whether additional stretch goals have been reached or not. You can also choose to get multiple pins of the same design.ŒæIf you choose the Fan Backer Package, you will get an additional reward, an illustrated digital portrait of a pet or other animal of your choice, made by me, the artist! Examples of my animal portraits can be found below and on Instagram/Deviantart at LabradoriteWolf:ŒæŒæThe project will raise money to pay for:Œæ"

300," Two years ago, I challenged myself in creating a short video every day. It started as an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of video making and to explore what creativity means when applied with such an intensity and continuity over time.Last year I kept the challenge but moved it to a different media: illustration. Once again, I wanted to practice something I don't do enough and do it, again, every day. What came out of it, is a journey of my year 2017: places I visited, people I met, travels I did, details I noticed, feelings transferred into drawings.

301," In 1892, we wore carnations.ŒæIn 1930, we wore monocles.ŒæIn 1973, we wore leather.ŒæIn 1995, we wore flannel.Queer people have been sending messages to each other through clothes and accessories for ages, and weäó»ve always had ways to find each other in a crowd. Queer Looks celebrates a selection of iconic aesthetics and symbols used by queer folks in the west from the last 150 years, through both a gorgeous fashion illustration zine and two emblematic enamel pins!About the zine:Queer Looks brings together seven amazing illustrators to create a survey of queer aesthetics and worn symbols from the 1800s to the near-present. The looks span from carnation codes in the 1890s, to the queer blues divas of the 1920s and 30s, and even to the denim and pins trends of the present day. The zine contains 12 gorgeous fashion-plate-style illustrations and is 16 pages in total.ŒæEDIT:ŒæThe zine will now be 20 pages long, with 13 illustrations and 3 extra pages of information about the zine's looks!About the pins:ŒæOne, a sleek, elegant peacock feather. In the 1800s, as with now, style of dress was a whole visual language and a peacock feather worn on the lapel was just one of many possible indicators that the wearer might not fit the heteronormative mold.Another, a good oläó» carabiner and ring of keys. A key ring clipped to a belt loop has been an understated, recognizable sign of queerness (specifically and most commonly a lesbian symbol) for decades, but it also represents a strength and comfort of identity that departs from sexuality. One more, a double-bladed axeäóîthe Minoan labrys. It was an essential symboläóîand agricultural tooläóîin the ancient matriarchal society of Knossos, and found a resurgence as a lesbian symbol and a symbol of women's rights in the 1970s and '80s. This pin was unlocked as the $3000 stretch goal!  The last, a simple black ring. Popularized on AVEN in the mid-2000s, the black ring has become a symbol of solidarity and a means of self identification for asexual folks. Harkening back to roman symbolism, the black represents both internal and external protection. This pin was unlocked as the $6500 stretch goal!Each pin is hard enamel, about 1äó at its longest point, and comes with a rubber clutch. Wildfeather is set in gold metal, Ring of Keys is set in gunmetal, and Labrynth and Caldera are set in silver.

302," 2/17///// UPDATE! We've hit the goal!! Stretch goals have been added below the deck descriptions! I'll be adding new ones as we move along ^___^2/28///// UPDATE! We've officially cleared all stretch goals! Check them out below the deck descriptions!The Neon Moon Tarot is a fully illustrated, 78-card tarot deck set in a retro-futuristic cyberpunk world using the archetypes and themes of a RWS tarot deck. Backers can expect a gritty urban hi-tech setting with a limited neon palette and heavy black inks.ŒæI've been able to work with different production sources to bring two different versions to this Kickstarter. The deck is available in both standard and pocket editions(details below).Using the unique flexibility and depth of symbolism in the tarot, the Neon Moon deck emphasizes atmosphere and world-building. The RWS archetypes are alive and well here, merged with cyberpunk themes.ŒæThe Neon Moon Tarot lives in its own unique world and does its best to bring you along. It asks you to use your gut to read meaning from the cards with intuition. But you aren't left out in the cold. Each card has associated keywords and quotes to get you started. If you'd like, you canŒæ check them out right now at www.neonmoontarot.comŒæŒæŒæŒæThe standard edition of The Neon Moon Tarot Deck measuresŒæ2.75 by 4.75 inches, and is printed on 300 GSM coated card stock. It comes complete with a custom rigid box and booklet.ŒæŒæŒæŒæThe pocket edition of The Neon Moon Tarot measures 57 by 97 millimeters on 14 pt C2S coated card stock, and comes with a custom tuck box.ŒæThanks to all of your support, we've hit the goal as of 2/17! Here are some extra goodies to look forward to as funding continues!ŒæThe Neon Moon setting is my original take on a cyberpunk world. You'll see the usual themes of hi-tech low-life, A.I., cyborgs, corporations run amok, and more. For my version of the world, there is a divisive plate separating the rich and powerful from the masses underneath.ŒæThe suit names have changed, along with the court cards, to better reflect the cyberpunk interpretation of this deck. They are as follows:ŒæAbove the plate, people can live essentially forever through a mixture of memory backups, clones, and ""gene-therapy"", which has resulted in a very strict society under constant surveillance by the most powerful members who have been alive for hundreds of years and in that time have accumulated power and wealth. The court cards effectively play the roles of those most powerful members of this society living on top of the world.ŒæFor the minor pips, they depict life beneath the plate. I've strayed a bit from convention and things are more of a neon-lit, urban mad max than they are Neo-Tokyo. People are mostly too poor to advertise to, so most of the advertisements are aimed at pure necessities. Gangs roam what's left of the streets, sponsored militias run through on orders from above the plate, poverty is rampant and conflict is everywhere. People live short and violent lives of desperate struggle, and find hope and strength through banding together with friends.ŒæOutdated robots, discarded from above, hack into each others' firmware with updates giving their A.I. freedom. Gene-therapy is largely experimental and therefore much less stable than above the plate.ŒæPeople have started giving themselves vanity alterations in addition to performance enhancing ones. The internet is patched from a local mesh of wires that are strung from building to building, from the underside of the plate down to the ground. This accounts for the imagery of the minor pips. Previous ideas of what it means to be human, imposed by the ruling class, struggle against the people who remake themselves into a thousand different versions of humanity.And yet something new arrives with a strange, neon pink full moon. Magic begins to surface in the city, along with strange occurrences and impossibilities. Somehow, it seems to be relative in power to the waxing and waning of the moon.ŒæEach card is meant to evoke a particular piece of this world, using the archetypes available from the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot. I chose tarot specifically to bring this setting to life as it allowed me to emphasize the ambiance and themes of the world while letting a larger cast of characters be depicted than other mediums would comfortably allow. As with any tarot deck, every card has a piece of story behind it, and every combination of cards tells a different story.ŒæŒæŒæŒæOut of the goal of $5500, funds are estimated to be allocated accordingly:The estimated timeline, and product status is as follows:ŒæŒæI'm James Brothwell, and this is both my second Kickstarter campaign, and my second complete tarot deck. My first campaign for The Sinking Wasteland TarotŒæwas fortunate enough to not just fund, but to hit all of its stretch goals as well! I've previously been involved with comics, computer games, movies, and the odd commission work that's landed me in strange and exciting places.ŒæThanks to the success of the last campaign, I was able to put my nose to the grindstone and finish up The Neon Moon Tarot, and I'm very pleased to be able to offer it for you all now. I started work on this in the last couple of months of 2016 and only recently finished artwork for the last of the cards at the end of January 2018.ŒæI'm hoping that this deck will speak to those who, like me, are sometimes left wanting for a tarot deck that depicts a more urban environment, and incorporates technology throughout.Introduction videoŒæMusic by Gavin Luke.Explanation video music by TeknoAXE.Images represent prototypes. Final product may differ slightly.I do offer worldwide shipping but I'm sorry to say that I have little control over shipping costs or customs fees. If you order from outside of the US, please be aware that I've done my best to keep weights down, prices affordable, and shipping tracked. Still, some things are simply beyond my control.ŒæFinally, thank you to all of the backers, friends, strangers, and fellow internet oddities whose enthusiasm and support allows projects like this to exist and thrive.

The 8 page story called Neverwhere was the beginning of what will be a 25 year ride into the depths of self-publishing Hell! My creations went on to gather cult followings such as RAZOR, CURSE OF SLEEPING BEAUTY (currently on Netflix), STRYKE, MORBID ANGEL, HEXANNE, HELL RIOT, TOMMI GUNN and many many more. By the mid 1990's the term ""badgirl comics"" was a common phrase in stores all over the world with my name as the ""godfather"" of the phrase, due to the success of my top female flagship titles. I was able to write my own rules as I created most of the 5 million books I self-published.

305," Hello, I'm Katherine C. Perry, also known as Thimsy, and I'm a freelance artist and illustrator. I am a mostly self-taught artist, with 15 years of sketchbooks weighing down my shelves, and multiple academic degrees in art sitting in a box somewhere. I am mostly inspired by video games, comics, natural history and mythology. As an artistically shy hermit, I've only been a part of one art show and this is what I feel to be my first real artistic foray out into the world. You can find me on Facebook, Etsy, Instagram and Patreon.My artistic style is usually described as whimsical and a little macabre with a lot of fine detail. UNFATHOMABLEŒæis a coloring book for grown ups that follows my artistic focus whichŒæis primarily on women and creatures from myth and legend. Why? Because, I am a woman, and I've had an interest in mythology since I was old enough to look at a book cover and go ""Ooh pretty!"". As I worked on this project my focus and style shifted a bit so I hope you enjoy seeing the transition.Coloring books are a great way for people of all ages to unplug and unwind while creating something beautiful with your creative spirit. UNFATHOMABLEŒæis a coloring book geared towards adults because some of the imagery may not be appropriate for young-uns and, really, adults need to unwind too.I've created 26 ink drawings for you to color, glue sequins and glitter on, or even use macaroni. You could even have a wine and chocolate night with friends and use your spilled Cabernet and a melted Dove chocolate bar to finger paint, if you so desire. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination! Unlike a lot of coloring books, each page is one-sided. So you won't have to ever choose between two drawings you like when you want to tear out your masterpiece and post it on your fridge.ŒæThe UNFATHOMABLEŒæcoloring book will be softcover, 8""x10"", with a total of 26 ink drawings and 56 pages. It will be printed by an online printer with the initial copies being printed with the funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign.Why Kickstarter?Kickstarter is a great platform for creators to share their projects and places the growth of a project back in the hands of creators and backers. As with all Kickstarter projects, if the $3,500.00 goal is not met, the project will end and no funds will be withdrawn from the backers. If the project does meet the goal, the funds will be withdrawn from the backers and the project will proceed and be completed by me.How will your money be allocated?ŒæGood question:Most of the money will go towards printing costs, some will go towards packaging and bonus stuff, and the rest will go towards processing and Kickstarter fees.Because you should see the awesome coloring adventures that await you.That means, if the proof copy looks as good as it should, I'll be able to place an order for the coloring books once the project is funded. You won't have to wait around for me to finish the illustrations.ŒæI'm also currently working on additional illustrations as a preemptive measure in case the stretch goals are met. I'm doing this so that there is as little time as possible between when the project is backed and when you get the coloring book and swag in the mail!If the $3,500 goal is met, I will be including a Kickstarter Exclusive 5""x7"" mini print and sticker of the illustration Desert Rose to any backer who backed a physical reward! Desert Rose WILL NEVER be produced again!This is my first Kickstarter so I've tried to keep my goal relatively modest. Consequently, if the goal of $3,500.00 is met, there are a number of stretch goals you can unlock! So share this project with your friends and earn goodies! Stretch goal goodies are applied to every pledge with a physical reward.GOAL 1 of $4,000.00Œæ UNLOCKS:- 1 Bookmark!

306," ŒæIntroductionŒæMy inspiration for this project is the pure minimalism in a vintage kind of style, where the icons symbolizes something familiar, but still in a abstract way. The serie is very little this time but to focus on few pieces, that have it's own characterization and quality. The blue color and the lines are to give the posters an elegant touch and also with the curves of the illustrations.ŒæBy combining 2 pieces, you can create a little kind of story or the 2 pieces will back each other up and will suit each other very well, because of their simple appearance.ŒæThrough this 12 days campaign, I hope you will find my vision interesting and unique.ŒæAbout meI'm a 22 year old female Danish artist, who works a lot with different prints but with a simplicity through the themes. I have launched a couple of campaigns on Kickstarter, and I enjoy to share it in this community, while i'm building up my portofolio and getting feedback on my work, for someday to fly away and start my own more professional and confident. The funds will go to production, shipping and for future projects as well to keep sharing more and more of my visions. All the prints will be printed on 200 gram silk satin paper and will be packed in a tube carefully for the best protection in the shipping.The prints will be shipped within 3 weeks after the end of the project, where a survey will be out.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ"

308," Prior to lives of piety and miraculous events they were often just regular folk like you and me, getting into trouble and doing silly things like living in a hollow chestnut tree or smashing a priest's nose with a rock or even corralling the enemies of their tribe into a hut and burning it all down into aŒæsmoldering ruin of ash and spite.While he wasn't known for immolating his enemies, Honore (or Honoratus in the Latin tongue) was evidently enough of a rascal as a child that when his former nursemaid heard that he had been appointed Bishop of Amiens, she struck her baker's peel to the ground and announced that she would believe it when her peel grew into a tree. Legend has it that her peel took root and grew into a mulberry tree that bore both flower and fruit.Honore was attributed with a variety of miracles. On one occasion during Mass, as Honore was holding the Host at the consecration, he experienced a vision of the hand of Christ holding the Host at that very same moment. This particular miracle is recorded within this illustration.Œæ A chapel was built in his honor, and it was at this chapel that local bakers formed their guild.Eventually canonized, Honore was appointed patron saint of bakers (as well as confectioners, bakers of altar bread, candle-makers, florists, flour merchants, corn chandlers, oil refiners, and pastry chefs). All religious aspects aside, he was a humble man who did good things and is now eternally associated with bread. You go, Honore!Inspired in equal parts by the tale of Honore and threats from my friend the pastry chef to cut off my weekly supply of freshly baked sweets, I have produced what I think is a lovely print honoring St. Honore and I am releasing it here on Kickstarter.The St. Honore print is being released in the following formats:ŒæŒæŒæPLUS! There are also the following one-of-a-kind rewards for the collector:Portfolio bundle:ŒæArtist's proofs and original pencil sketch, plus 1 each mini-card, small print, 24k signed & numbered full-size print.Original artwork bundle:ŒæOriginal 14"" x 17"" black & white ink artwork w/ 24k gold leaf, personalized letter from the artist, plus 1 each mini-card, small print, and #1 in the 24k signed & numbered full-size print edition. The original artwork will be gilded prior to shipping (and I'll post a photo of the gilded work as an update so you know what you're getting).As a final note, every print is produced in my own workshop using pigmented inks on Epson Cold Press Bright Signature Worthy archival papers (100% cotton fiber, acid-free, lignin-free, 340gsm). Although prints are rated for 200+ years, no guarantees are made as to their longevity (but don't hang them in direct sunlight and they should outlast you).Need an extra one of these and two of those? Once you make a pledge, you can adjust your pledge and simply increase it by however much you need to for a given reward. Once the funding period is over, I'll send out a backer survey where there will be a space for you to tell me exactly what the extra money is for.Add $2.00 per additional mini-cardAdd $10.00 per additional small printAdd $30.00 per additional bespoke printAdd $95.00 per additional 24k signed & numbered printStretch goals can get really confusing really quickly and I may yet be tipsy from carnival season in New Orleans so I'd like to keep it simple:Œæ$1,500 GOAL: If funding reaches $1,500.00 then every backer will also receive 1 mini-card as a thank you!$6,000 GOAL: If funding reaches $6,000.00 then every backer pledgingŒæ$35.00 or more will receive a laser-etched acrylic 'coin' depicting St. Honore as a special bonus!The artwork is done and I only need a few backers to purchase the inks and paper to begin producing the prints. I expect that I'll begin shipping mid-April 2018. The production of promised stretch goals could impact the production schedule, but not significantly (see Risks and Challenges below).Boring, but important.US backers: Shipping is covered in the cost of the pledge. Whee!International backers: Please add the indicated amount to help defray the additional cost of shipping. Please consider the small extra charge meeting half-way.In some countries, customs duties may be applied to to your reward and I have no way of predicting if theyäó»ll apply to yours. Customs inspections seem to be very arbitrary and while most rewards scoot through without any extra duties, a few of you may find that a fee has been slapped on. I canäó»t predict it or avoid it, and I will not fudge the value of the reward in an effort to evade them.PLUSŒæif you are an international backer and receive a tracking number for your reward, please track your package daily! Sometimes rewards will get hung up in the system and returned to me and then things may get awkward. Monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptlyäóîbefore the authorities send the package back to me."

310," I'm asking you to give me money so that I can hold an online design competition. I will create a website that has a call for submissions. I want all kinds of designers: theme park designers, architects, artists, chefs, little kids, furniture makers, sculptors and any and all creative types to submit their ideas for a one mile stretch of wall along the border of the United States and Mexico.ŒæSure they'll pay for the wall but not my contest. I won't charge an entry fee to enter the contest because it's about building bridges not walls. All the money I raise in this campaign up to $5525 will go for prize money. I chose that amount because there are 5525 miles of border between the US and Mexico. So the winner will receive $3000. Then there'll be second and third place prizes. Second place is $1000 and third is $500. That leaves a little money to build the website and administer the contest. My math is pretty bad - probably after fees that doesn't leave anything.You won't believe it, wait til you see. We're going to have tremendous designers submit really terrific designs. It'll really be the best design competition ever. Bigly! One thing that will help get interesting designers to submit is the prize money but once I have that I want to approach judges who can help evaluate the submissions. Established designers in a variety of different fields will add credibility and interest. But first, I need money.How will I get these judges? Good question. ŒæI'm Steve Tatham and I run the Creative Group at Universal Studios Japan. I've been in the theme park business for many years and know lots of creative people. So once I have some prize money and can guarantee this is a going concern then I'll approach well known designers to be judges. Then we'll make a website and then people can begin to submit their awesome designs!"

And after long discussing we decided to launch the educational project. Firstly, it is innovative! We wanted to modernize the summer camps. The camps that are now functioning are very old. The infrastructure need a serious reforms, if we want to attract children. We wanted to make it more interesting! THREEHOUSE SUMMER CAMP! Secondly, as we have foreign experience and some of us also have worked in summer camps abroad. We wanted to share our experience with children and attract also foreign language teachers to give the children to opportunity to learn languages. LANGUAGE COURSES INCLUDED! Thirdly, the program will be aimed at children from low-income and fatherless families. A lot of families in Asia have not enough resources for childrenäó»s education abroad. We hope, our project will help to develop the talents! EDUCATE FUTURE GENIUSES! The price for one child and 1 season will be approximately 180 Euro. We think, it will be fair price to cover all costs (teachers, courses, entertainments) and the middle level comparing to other summer camps. "

314," Our principle of breaking down boundaries between art, science and technology, leads us to conducting artistic projects that link those three disciplines. Here is how Quanta arises, a curatorial project that explores different appropriations of quantum physics theory from personal experience and study field by each one of artists and scientists that make up four work pairs. The project splits into three phases: In the first one (February 1 to March 31, 2017), artists and scientists will share their knowledge to start a creation process; In the second one (April 1 to May 31, 2017), each collaborative pair will develop a research and creation work along four months based on the five properties of quantum physics: wave particle duality, quantum entanglement, superimposition of states, quantum tunneling and the uncertainty principle, to develop an artistic project. In the third phase (June 8 to July 7, 2017) will be a public exhibition of the processes generated during the second phase in the Colombian art space Estudio 74.Different Colombian Artists and collectives participate in Quanta: Angí©lica Piedrahita (lapiedrahita.com), El Desguazadero Colectivo - Marí_a Fernanda Mora del Rí_o and Juan Josí© Lí_pez (bit.ly/2k8SXrE) and Colectivo Reset - Nikolai Rubio and Ginna Velíçsquez. As an a special guest the project counts with the participation of the Mexican artist Arcíçngelo Constantini, pionner in the production of art with technology and Net.Art, whose research and development is integrally activated by the link between artistic and technological processes. www.arc-data.net.Jose Jairo Giraldo, quantum physicist of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (bit.ly/2k8QUnA), Santiago Vargas, astrophysicist of the National Astronomical Observatory (bit.ly/2k8Mi0I), and Verí_nica Arias, astrophysicist of the Universidad de Los Andes are part of the Colombian scientists work group. In the international context, the project will count with a scientific representative of the Universidad Nacional Autí_noma de Mí©xico. With the support of different collaborators we will be able to carry out the creation processes of each work pairs, which will materialize in artistic pieces, installations and other art works of art for their exhibition. Support these creations leads to promote different perspectives and actions that detonate a possibility of innovation in different artistic - scientific processes and national collective thinking (Colombia) for its visibility in an international stage. With the impact generated, Quanta would fulfill its objective of integrating science with art for its application as a social fabric.FundingPhysical resources (Art work production, museography, communications, assembly, dismantling): 17.334 USDHuman resources (Airplane tickets Mexico - Colombia - Mexico, travel expenses, fees): 2.176 USDContingencies: 1.904 USDTotal: 21.414 USD The economic support we expect to raise through Kickstarter is 10.059 CA, and although it is not the entire projected budget, it will be exclusively destinated for the art work production. We believe that without art work the project would not exist, so the artistic-scientific development will always be the economic priority. Exclusive perksAs a gratefulness for the financial support, we will offer to our collaborators some exclusive perks:Inmersive tourWe will keep the collaborators abreast of the development of the work pairs (artist - scientist) research and creation processes through videos that record the generated experiences. We will send the videos to the collaborators, also, they will have access to them through our YouTube channel.Digital project catalogueWe will design a digital catalogue with the photographic records of the work pairs creation processes and artistic pieces, descriptive texts and the Quantaäó»s curatorial text, including special thanks to the collaborators. The catalogue will be sent to each collaborator in a time no longer than one month, after the conclusion of the exhibition.Quantum videoWe will make a video compilation of the three phases of the project, in which we will present unpublished contents, unique details of the evolution of work pairs research and creation processes, testimonies by artists, scientists and Reactanteäó»s members and exclusive scenes from the exhibition and guided tours. The video will be sent to each collaborator in a time no longer than one month, after the conclusion of the exhibition.Customized postcardsWe will design personalized digital postcards for collaborators (including their name) with unique photographs of the project or the created art works or their process, accompanied by a representative phrase of a work pair or the quantum physics theory. The postcards will be sent to each collaborator in a time no longer than one month, after the conclusion of the exhibition.In addition to receiving these exclusive perks, the collaborators will be mentioned in all graphic pieces of the project, museographic texts, press releases and Reactanteäó»s digital media (web page and social media).ŒçWe invite you to promote Colombiaäó»s ART and SCIENCE supporting Quanta!--------------------Quanta es un proyecto curatorial que explora diferentes apropiaciones de la teorí_a de la fí_sica cuíçntica, desde la experiencia personal y campo de estudio de cada uno de los artistas y cientí_ficos que conforman cinco duplas de trabajo.

Be it a marriage, engagement, pinning, or BFFFFFF eternal bonding for all people regardless of their ""label.""ŒæThe idea was inspired by Hooman Moayyed after his 2016 burn. This is his first Burning Man art project.""I was inspired to build this because I Playa proposed to a dear friend last year. I had rings and all! I had no idea when I would give the ring, or who I would give it to. I just wanted to manifest my life partner. One night at the food line inside The Kazbah's camp, along comes my fabulous friend adorned in her 8 pointed antler headdress. I just knew it was right so I got on one knee and proposed enternal Burnal BFFship to her. She was shaking. She said yes! Our improvised ritual was very real to us both. We still share this unique bond today. There's nothing I would love more than to allow others to experience their own personal bonding ritual under the Mandap. When BM HQ announced this year's theme, I just knew I had to do this.""ŒæThe design will be roughly based on a traditional mandap (above) but with some additional playafications. The entire structure will be illuminated with multicolor LEDs that are interactive (well ya!). ŒæThe lights will change patterns through changeable programs or it can react to vocal and music patterns (of course they will!).Help us acquire the supplies necessary to build this place of public assembly built to perpetuate love through strengthened human connections.

Bond with as many people as you love. Everyone you and your partner bonds with adds to your own Playa family.äóÂŒæ3. It must be rooted in love. Not to be taken frivolously. äóÂŒæ4. It's unconventional. Your default-world spouse doesn't necessarily have to be your Playa spouse but it's amazing if you can be both. äóÂ5. You also may Playa marry or bond with anyone even if you're already conventionally married. Bond with your BFF or anyone who's close to you.Œæ6.

You may become playa ""engaged"" in the default world but cannot be playa joined there. You must be on the Playa to transition to a Playa union. äóÂ8. Your officient can be anyone you choose. No need for ordainment as you can be anyone you like on the Playa. The ceremony can be anything you choose.äóÂ9. Playa unions don't have to be sexual (but it's when when they are!). You can marry your BFF if you like. Consummation optional. äóÂŒæ10. These are not rules. Do whatever the F you want. See you under the Mandap!"

Be it a marriage, engagement, pinning, or eternal BFF bonding for all people monogamous, polygamous and solygamous (regardless of whatever -ous you choose, you are still a part of US).  äóìUnbeknownst to ourselves, we humans often harbor internal pain that isolates us from other loving individuals. Though our our goal is to offer a safe space for people to bond directly with one another on the Playa through marriage or other bonding rituals, the struggle is to motivate all to create compassionate, loving, supportive and inclusive human unions. The ultimate union is between ourself and the world, with supportive friends, immersed, present and included within our heart.äóThe design will resemble three beings clasping hands in a 20'x20' circle.  Within the circle is where the bonding rituals will take place. Of course there will be some additional playafications. The entire structure will be illuminated with colored LEDs so that you can bond day or night.  The lights will change patterns through changeable programs or it can react to vocal and music patterns.

All funds generated here will be used to build the structure and its components.The 10 Playa Union Principles:1. It's Forever. Even after death.2. It's Polygamous and polyamorous. Bond with as many people as you love. Everyone you and your partner bonds with adds to your own Playa family.3. It must be rooted in love. Not to be taken frivolously. 4. It's unconventional. Your default-world spouse doesn't necessarily have to be your Playa spouse but it's amazing if you can be both.5. You also may Playa marry or bond with anyone even if you're already conventionally married. Bond with your BFF or anyone who's close to you. 6. Once you're joined at the hip, just add a ""P"" to your relationship status such as P.Wifey, P.Hubby, P.Bestie, P.Master, or P.Slave.7. You may become playa ""engaged"" in the default world but cannot be playa joined there. You must be on the Playa to transition to a Playa union. 8. Your officiant can be anyone you choose. No need for ordainment as you can be anyone you like on the Playa. The ceremony can be anything you choose.9. Playa unions don't have to be sexual (but it's when when they are!). You can marry your BFF if you like. Consummation optional.10. These are not rules. Do this any way you like!See you back home!"
317," For over 75 years astronomers have been sending messages via radio transmissions into space in an attempt to contact advanced alien civilizations, but so far no reply.Many messages have been sent,Œæ from series of prime numbers to Beatles songs, but maybe not the most important message äóñ love.Artist/inventor, Stefan Verstappen has designed a public art installation that will literally beam love into space.Greetings From PLANET EARTH is an interactive light, sound and mind installation to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Voyager Spacecraft with a spectacular twist, your brain interacts with the installation and the universe!How It WorksHoused inside a geodesic dome are 8 äóÖMind Podsäó» arranged in a circle around a central processing hub. Each pod is equipped with a neurofeedback headset that will record each personäó»s unique brainwave pattern and, using a computer graphics interface, project those patterns onto the inside of the dome in a 3D immersive experience.ŒæŒæEach person is encouraged to remember someone they love, like a spouse, family member, friend, or pet. Imagine 8 people from different walks of life, whose brains are linked together through a central computer, sharing thoughts of love, and having those thoughts projected onto the interior of the dome.ŒæA digital recording of the brainwave frequencies is then up-loaded to a 500 watt 60 foot dish transmitter and beamed directly into the center of our milky way galaxy!But Thereäó»s Moreäó_What if you could send your personal message into space, and include a return address?Before leaving the exhibit, each attendee can record a 30 second audio message to include in the transmission with their personal brain scan. There are dozens of scientific studies that prove that electro magnetic waves can directly influence and communicate with our brains.It is theoretically possible, if you sent a message into space paired with your unique brain frequency, advanced civilizations receiving your message could reply by transmitting a signal tuned to your specific frequency. Aliens could, theoretically, talk directly to your consciousness.Greetings From Planet Earth will tour art festivals and fairs across the US in the summer of 2018.""Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance.""Nikola TeslaŒæŒæAbout NeurofeedbackNeurofeedback is a type ofŒæbiofeedbackŒæthat measures brain waves to produce a signal that can be used as feedback to teach self-regulation of brain function.ŒæNeurofeedback is commonly provided using video or sound, with positive feedback for desired brain activity and negative feedback for brain activity that is undesirable.For this installation we will use a neurofeedback headset that will record each person's EEGŒæand send that signal through a computer graphics program that will transform the signal into a changing color graphic that is projected using 3D projection technology, onto the inside of the dome.Each person will see their own real-time brain activity in 3D on the screen in front of them.ŒæAbout 3D Dome ProjectionThe term äóìfulldomeäó is used to describe immersive dome-based video projection environments that create 360 degree and virtual reality experiences. Pre-rendered digital video and animation, real-time, interactive and live captured images can be displayed on the inside of a domed projection surface to create an immersive viewing experienceŒæAlthough the current technology emerged in the early-to-mid 1990s, fulldome environments have evolved from numerous influences, including immersive art and storytelling, with technological roots in domed architecture, planetariums, multi-projector film environments, flight simulation, and virtual reality. Contemporary configurations employ raster video projectors, either singly or grouped together to cover the dome surface with full-color images and animations.How Do We Plan to Send Radio Signals into Space?ŒæWe will rent broadcasting time on theŒæJamesburg Earth Station, in central California, a 500 watt, 98 ft radio dish built in 1968.It has been suggested that the frequency range known as the äóìwater holeäó (between 1.42 and 1.66 GHz, the hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) frequencies), which is a particularly quiet band of frequencies, would be the best place to attempt interstellar communications, and so has been a popular range for listening in SETI experiments.This is the frequency at which hydrogen vibrates. Not every society is going to have a base ten number system. Not every civilization is going to use certain frequencies for cell phones, and not every song will sound the same through a different atmosphere. But it's unlikely that whatever corner of the universe the signal ends up in will have a more basic atom than hydrogen. This is the way to get a civilization to notice you.ŒæWhy Am I Doing This?ŒæI began experimenting with biofeedback and brainwave entrainment more than 40 years ago. I bought my first EEG machine when I was 19 and while monitoring my brain waves I subjected myself to binaural beats that ŒæI created on a synthesizer and split the channels to stereo headphones, strobe lights tuned to various frequencies, and innumerable recordings of sacred music, chants and tones to see for myself the effects these would have on my consciousness.Way back then I already had the idea to create a machine that resembled the device called ""Cerebro"" as seen in the recent X-Men movies, but 40 years ago the technology didn't exist to do what I wanted to do.With a lifelong passion for science and technology, I have kept abreast of the tech needed to finally create the ultimate interactive mind experience.About 15 years ago the technology was finally able to do what I needed, but now the problem was funding. All that tech and equipment is expensive where could I go to find funding for such a project?But along with advancement in technology there came an advancement in financing - crowdfunding. Kickstarter is the greatest opportunity to fund such a weird, but wonderful idea. The kickstarter community is probably the only community of people in the world that would 'get' what I'm trying to do because, well, you're all probably as 'non-ordinary' as me.Am I Capable of Completing This Project?ŒæFor my installation Tubular Zen, which used harmonic sounds and light frequencies to induce meditative states among those that interacted with it, I not only built and installed the actual structure, I also personally soldered together 15 circuit boards and wired the whole, thing myself.For my installation, Tri-Monic, which combined a half dozen instruments all programmed to play in harmony no matter who played them, I rented $300,000. worth of computers, mixers, auto tuners and harmonizers and wired the whole thing up myself.Greetings From Planet Earth will be a lot easier to build than my previous projects since all the components are self contained and need only be put together in this unique configuration and I won't have to solder or wire anything.In addition, I will hire the services of my partners Pacific Domes, Obscura Digital, andŒæInteraXonŒæto calibrate the projectors, and integrate the computers and software.The DomeFor this installation we will be working with multi-award winning Pacific Domes,ŒæŒæthe original manufacturer of geodesic domes worldwide. Expanding on the both the architectural and philosophical concepts of the legendary engineer and futurist R. Buckminster Fuller, Pacific Domes has helped pave the way for the global eco-living revolution while shaping the event dome industry for over 35 years.The Pacific Domes Projection Dome is a 360ŒÁ fully immersive viewing environment. Their patented negative air pressure projection system is the perfect platform for state of the art 360ŒÁ surround projection. Their partner companies,ŒæObscura Digital, Vortex Immersion and Immersive Experiential are experts in creating multimedia surround projection technology. Together, they create multi-sensory, interactive learning and entertainment experiences for large scale group immersive environments.Brain Sensing TechnologyFor this installation we plan to use headsets produced byŒæInteraXonŒæa Toronto-based innovator in the field of brain-sensing technology, with a history of designing memorable experiences from a levitating chair to a brain powered beer tap. Over 50,000 people have experienced InteraXonäó»s brain-sensing technology, and this continues to grow.BudgetŒæ$35,000?! What's all that for?This may sound like a lot of money (because it is), but after Kickstarter fees and reward fulfillment, this will leave the minimum required to cover the cost of bringing Greetings From Planet Earth to life.Here's a breakdown of where the costs go:Fees and reward fulfillment: $10,500Greetings From Planet Earth project costs: $24,500:Past Experiments in Art, Sound, Lights and FrequenciesŒæArtwalk, Ventura, California, 2008Tubular ZenŒæis a multi-media, multi-sensory interactive installation artwork that combines the concepts of Zen and Synesthesia.The five pillars represent, and play, the five notes of the Pentatonic scale. A pentatonic scale is an ancient musical structure found all over the world that consists of five tones or notes.As you enter the circle of pillars you notice that each one has a lighted button on its side.Touching the button will cause the pillar to come to life. First you will hear a single lonely musical note from aŒæShakuhatchiŒæflute playing one of the five notes of the pentatonic scale.Then the pillar will light up with light flickering in the same frequency as the musical note.A few seconds later and the pillar returns to its former repose.By walking around the circle of pillars and pressing the buttons you will discover that each pillar has a different sound, color, and vibration. Activate the pillars in any random order will produce 16 different harmonious sounds.When all pillars are activated you will hear the eerie but soothing äóÖCäó» diminished 7th cord.Nuit Blanche, Toronto, 2015Tri-MonicŒæis a multi-sensory interactive installation that requires viewers to interact musically with the installation.Three 12 foot tall triangular shaped pieces create a classical equilateral triangle both vertically and horizontally.All the microphones and instruments were run through a series of harmonizers and auto tuners so that even if one couldn't sing on key or play an instrument, not matter what you did the sound would always come out in harmony.This is installation brought strangers together to create music and harmony, and a spiritual experience.ŒæCyberpunk, Strobe Light Wearable Art, Dragons' Den, Toronto, 2014Handmade brass pendants with internal hand soldered circuit board with battery, 555 microchip, and LED lights.

319," Imagine what Galileo faced when he claimed in his publishing to the scientific community, that the Earth revolved around the heavens. The theory proven only then by the great Issac Newton. When the church was still a dominant force, for Galileo, nothing good came of it.ŒæWe are living post 500 years into the future and scientists have discovered the answers to more modern day theories that ultimately are the standard for questions that pertained to unknown and unverifiable facts in the heart of mysterious forces of what more, the universe. Philosophical thinkers and scientists posed questions that served as beacons of light and were in no way afraid to challenge nature and the universe leading to scientific discovery. If we are to keep surviving it seems inevitable that the future of humanity rests on the thinkers and innovators that know the world doesn't give up its answers without a fight for survival or ultimately be doomed into a catastrophic apocalypse. I believe that life doesn't come with guarantees, but it's ultimately up to you to make the choices that will shape your life. I've had a share of bad experiences and growing up was no easy undertaking, I rarely complained about going to school though. I never once planned for college. When I finally graduated there was no internet boom Kickstarter and YouTube didn't exist. Smart phones, couldn't get your hands on one. So from a technologist point of view, life was pretty much primitive in decision making.One thing is definitely true, our experiences in this world shape who we are and the people we meet will decide our fate. As humans we are told to use discretion and learn to make choices to better our reality and the current situation we may find ourselves in from day to day. Sometimes life doesn't provide you with a way out, a way to get back your happiness, your sanity, everything that made you full of life.ŒæSo it's with my KickstarterŒæcampaign that I want to share with my fan community and anyone who is a true die-hard Zelda fan, or maybe just love to solve puzzles, well wrap your mind's live action adventure crime solving skills around this one! So if you have been there from the start and for those who walk behind them thinking to themselves, ""Gee you know, I think i like this game."" This is the sum of all existential crisis's to have happen and live to tell about it 10 years later. To me, this game is rooted in my mind with a deeper subconscious meaning. One that either tried to spare my life or have me buried before my 23rd birthday. The story which I present to you has a classical, theme to it in that the character in which my life was played out was flawed in nature. His self awareness was lacking, his attention span was that of a teen with ADHD, and his self conscious fear is what kept him on the run, afraid to give his life and change his ways or one day meet his unforeseen fateful future.The exhibit is to show that my Kickstarter campaign has potential to make people, fans, restore their faith in life. That there is a connection with the physical world and the spiritual as well as the technological one in the cities that make up this story.Nothing in this story was based on some inclination of what if! I was just a teen living out my days doing crazy stupid things that were all kind of familiar already. So I had no easy way to put stupid acts aside, I guess I always stayed in character while the rest of the world has plotted on their futures. In the end I'm 100 percent positive that there will never ever be another story like this or as fun in solving a past life action adventure crime drama. I guarantee this is the melting pot of all classical action adventure true life crime dramas that blends, the virtual world of video games, art, the internet and the book by Dan Brown, ""The DaVinci Code"".the story has many types of themes which connects with just about everyone not just Zelda Fans, because most Zelda fans are not DaVInci Code Fanatics. By then end of this book I'm sure I will get you to believe in the power of your actions to find meaning in your life and restore your faith. Bringing this Kickstarter campaign is like giving you a piece of my mind to take you back to the days I never foreseen fate coming to get me and give you a chance to solve the crime the way I was meant to but never did. There is nothing in this story that never happened or that I didn't live through. In the end meant it was Game Over!Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ ŒæŒæI'm raising funds to put together an exhibit here in Los Angeles where all the characters in the story I've written about in my experiences as a teen, doing drugs, chasing after affection and my only way to connect with my self through art and video games was a way of life before the Internet boomed into the mainstream world. The characters in the stories have also been through life altering spiritual struggles and are still lucky to be alive and living in Los Angeles today who I'm still in contact with. They don't however know of my hermetic past and although they were all part of my teen years, I didn't fully understand what I was living through until I took a step back from that fateful night that shifted everything into perspective. I went to college to decipher my own complex social world I was thrust into. What you only thought was imaginary gibberish, in my past and present life did actually exist. You'll also get a glimpse of my other lesser known creations that I have been working on years after I regained composure and worked to try and revive my soul.ŒæMy wonderful ""Zelda"" painting, tying the story of my life together.ŒæOil  11""x 14""ŒæŒæca. 2004My other current ideas and how I perceive they can help the world.Gigstreamer-Social event website built to ease the complexity of a artist/promoter booking system to create events.ŒæStrike Out Game-Lottery number generator that I invented which is based on an algorithm I also made that may be a primitive form of the most basic A.I to win the lotto defeating the odds by 98 percent.ŒæChildren's Story Book Literature Series- This is a series of children's stories written by me that guide children from ages 3-17 learn to follow their visual thought process and ask questions about their every day experiences when it's time to use their imagination but don't know where to start creating thoughts in the right order. It's brain power for the soul.ŒæBurgers On Us Game- This is a teen to adult card game that gets them into a real life scenario of what it's like to work at a fast-food burger restaurant. they calculate cost, incorrect orders, and tally up results in a game of probability to determine a winner all by using a deck, pad and a pencil.The Event will have a bar so if you decide to come drinks will be served."

324," Okay! Hello everyone!I never thought i would actually be making a kickstarter, but i realized i dont think there is any way i would be able to afford everything i need for my senior show project, by the time i have to start working on it, therefore i have talked to a number of people about it, and they have all directed me here! So, here i am!Basically, over this summer i have spent a lot of time figuring out what i want to do for my senior show project, I am in Illustration Major at Otis college of Art and Design, for those of you who didn't know that. I came up with a really interesting idea for how to put a twist onto the typical illustration senior projects. I have started working with dolls over summer, and i have fallen in love. I began by taking Monster High Dolls, and stripping the makeup off their faces, and redrawing their faces on using watercolor pencils. I love this method, and its super fun, however, its still not entirely my work, since the bodies and the proportions are not completely to my liking. One of the main reasons i have created this kickstarter page, is to ask all you beautiful souls for help with affording real BJD dolls. BJD dolls, or Ball Jointed Dolls, are usually custom made, very flexible, very realistic dolls. They have balls in each of their joints so they move like a real person and can be posted in almost every way that a real human could move. Everything from the skin, to the hands, to the eyes, to each freckle on the dolls body is customizable.Œæ These dolls can range anywhere from $300-$1000 .... which is A LOT. I will be buying doll parts, and arranging them myself, which should bring the cost down by a couple hundred per doll. My goal is to have at least 4 dolls, an elder, an adult, a teen, and a child. If i could get more, that would be phenomenal. however i think making four dolls is going to be quite the load of work as it is. What i am planning on building is a giant fish tank type of container, and inside will be the fairies den. It will be a miniature forest, with everything from mushrooms, to small bug creatures, to the little huts the fairies live inside of. I want to create a scene, of just a moment in time in the every day life of fairies. A photograph of their world, so to speak, but one that you can see from all angles.ŒæI will design each fairy as a character, with a full backstory, and name and all that good stuff. They will have their own biographies nearby the instillation, along with a story as to why i have chosen this, and the meaning behind my work, and especially behind why fairies have so much meaning in our society today, without anyone even realizing or noticing it.ŒæI am writing my senior Capstone paper on the topic of fairies as well, specifically their history and the role they used to play, and continue to play in society. Going back from when people thought they were real, to when people would paint them all the time, to peter pan and neverland. I am beyond excited for this project, and i am really really asking you all to jump on board and get excited about this with me! The more support and help i receive, the more pumped i will be about this, and the cooler it would look, im sure! If you want to offer a helping hand, please dont be afraid to message me, i am going to need some help setting it all up when the time comes around, however for now, its all about getting my materials together!I will be giving those who donate $25 or more a handmade card, unique to them, attached with fairy dust from my very own fairies that have come to life with your help. To those who donate more than $100 i will draw you an image, just for you, and send that to you, along with your handmade personalized card, and fairy dust.Thank you all so so so so so much, i am BEYOND excited to get this project started!!!Ps- it's still in the design phase so things might and probably will change over time, I am considering building the entire thing myself using paper mache and other materials.... I'll keep you all posted, it's gonna be AMAZING!!!!!!!"
325," A project by Caspar Noyons and the Tolhuistuin for the Amsterdam LightfestivalŒæDecember 17th 2015 till January 17th 2016.ŒæSpeed Of Light is a scale model of the solar system (1:270.000.000) where the visitor can walk the distance between the earth and the sun at relative light-speed.ŒæWe are removed 150.000.000 km from our sun and light travels at 300.000 km/s. This means the light of the sun takes exactly 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach us. These simple facts are known already for centuries but how well do we understand them? And even more importantly: How much is this modern cosmology part of our popular culture? It seems in every mythology this cosmology, or the place humans inhabit in the universe, is of tremendous importance. A place where separate individuals can gather, meet and celebrate this great cosmos we are all a part of.Location and LED path: All we really need for this installation is a long line of 555m in order for the visitor to be able to follow a LED path (3 LED per meter, 1665 LED's in total) showing the exact speed of 4km/h which is slow walking pace. This journey will then take the amount of time required: 8.3 minutes. A perfect place for this is the IJpromenade in the North of Amsterdam. Next to the IJ Canal it offers a great open space next to the water along a long straight line of just the right size.Host: Another thing we need is a festival this project is a part of so people come and experience this light installation and we can gather sponsors and partners to make this project happen. What about the Amsterdam Lightfestival ?ŒæNow we can really start making it happen.How do we build the earth and the moon?ŒæThey will only be respectively 4,7cm and 1.4 cm in diameter. They will light up on the side facing the sun so visitors can see them well. Also the big circle functioning as a fence surrounding the earth shows the path of the moon around the earth. (the moon is placed on top of this steel structure).ŒæImagine the moon takes a whole month to complete one full circle. This is just 90 degrees per week and its traveling as fast as the fastest airplanes on earth...ŒæAnd of course the sun !ŒæThis part is more complicated. The sun proportionately is about 100 times bigger than the earth. Not 4,7 cm but 5.16 meters in diameter... Standing next to earth it will look exactly as big in the skyline as the sun really looks to us from earth in the sky. The IJpromenade will look for 4 weeks like a star wars movie with two suns..ŒæFor it to really stand out we will put it on a 7 meter metal pillar so it is standing 2 meters high in the air. People will be able to sit and walk around it and make pictures so it looks they are lifting the sun up with their arms.And finally we need a space gate so the visitor can really make the transformation from common mortal to giant light being walking at light-speed and holding the earth in the palm of his hand.ŒæWe have been busy the past year finding other sponsors and partners that are now making the project possible: Stadsdeel Noord (City of Amsterdam) Shell, who have their research center near the project and the UNESCO international year of Light 2015 who are using the project as a platform for closing their year of events. Other foundations public and private have made generous contributions to making this project a reality.Being so much centered around the visitor, and receiving such encouraging reactions from people around us we chose to make a crowd-funding for the Sun. It will develop a community around the project and the guided tours offered as rewards including costumes music and stories will really make the project come alive. Also we saw a lot of potential for education, so anŒæeducational program is being developed by students of the UPVA as part of a 2 week internship to invite 10 classes in 5 schools in the surrounding area to come and learn about space and the power of science.For the production we chose 3ŒæspecializedŒæcompanies, one in inflatable advertisingŒæ(for the SUN) one in LED Lighting for the LED path and one in stage design for the earth, the moon and the space gate. The technical team of Lightfestval will keep an eye on theŒæfeasibilityŒæof the project and theŒæTolhuistuin Foundation is managing the budget together with the artist. Working together we have aŒæcompetentŒæteam of experiences people that canŒælive up to the task of executing this exciting but also challenging project.Guided tours: 25, 50 Eur. and up. ŒæAs a tourguide in the most beautiful museums of amsterdam Caspar Noyons will be welcoming you in his cosmic costume guiding you like virgil through your epic journey towards the sun. Filled with stories about mythologies, creation myths and facts of science and space you will be able to become a full inhabitant of this solar system. To use Carl Sagan's words: We are a way for the cosmos to know itself. The exploration of the cosmos is a voyage of self discovery. We are made of stardust.If you can't make it to the guided tour: Tell us if you are not able to come to amsterdam this winter and we will send you a postcard instead ! Signed by the artist plus a print of a A4 drawing.Video:100 Eur. and up. As you might have noticed we have major video skills at our disposal (thanks to Oculus film) to create an incredible after-movie of the whole process and especially the performances of music dance and costumes around the different stages.Drawings: Apart from people other invitations have been sent: Spirit gods of mythologies from all over the world are joining the celebration. In the drawings are some of the visitors you can expect.In total 9 A4 drawings have been made. If needed, more could be made with a limit of 20 total.2 more drawings are made on another format: 25x35 and thicker glossier paper. Backers of 500 and up can choose between one of those or 2 smaller A4 drawings. Limit: 15ŒæŒæThe larger drawings: 35 x 50 cm, limited to 5. (3 already made)ŒæHopefully once this project is produced we will have most of the elements at our disposal to produce this installation on other festivals, and at much smaller costs.ŒæBy contributing to this project we can make this first and crutial step in a series of productions each time welcoming other performances and content around the different stages. We will then be curating our own cosmic shows !"

327," In the summer of 2015, the Magic Room was born.. Tucked away behind an otherwise unassuming door was an immersive conceptual art experience created by artist Liz Avalon within her booth at the annual Sawdust Art Festival in Laguna Beach, California. Visitors stepping inside the room found themselves unexpectedly transported out of the traditional art and craft festival experience and into a separate world of infinity mirrors, music, and lights. This Kickstarter is going to bring the magic room to others to enjoy.Over 5000 people visited the Magic Room in 2015, but it's time at the Sawdust Festival is over. Sawdust Festival tradition has all artists dismantle their booths in January allowing the festival artists to rebuild and transform the grounds with new booths in new locations the following spring. Next year, the Magic Room will be gone and Liz''s Sawdust Festival booth will have a new location and a new innovative art installation.HOWEVER....so many people have asked for the Magic Room to returnŒæthat Liz has decided to take the show on the road! This Kickstarter Campaign was started to recreate the Magic Room in a new innovative mobile format!!!!With $8,000, we can build a great MOBILE MAGIC ROOM!!!!The form it will take depends on a few things, but mostly on the funds that are raised.Œæ$8,000 will cover design and building costs to make a Magic Room that contains all the fun of the Sawdust Magic Room,in a format that is self-contained and can be easily transported from place to place.Any funds generated beyond $8,000 will allow for greater flexibility in design, more exciting and refined features, and a budget to expose more people to the magic room. This includes stuff like a more interesting and better quality trailer or vehicle for it to be placed on/within, improved sound systems, solar power, and artistic expression on the outside as well as the inside.ŒæOnce it is built, any extra money will be dedicated to sharing the fun.The more money we raise, the more interesting the adventures the Magic Room can have and the more people will be able to visit. Everywhere the Magic Room will go has yet to be seen, but the plan is to make it a travelling art experience that can go to events, festivals, schools, fairs, and even pop up in truly unexpected places. The MOBILE MAGIC ROOM can visit anywhere. Let's share the experience!ŒæŒæIt's BIGGER ON THE INSIDE!!!!"
328," My art career started in earnest in Washington, DC, when I first used my multiple exposure technique on the Space Window, a spectacular piece of stained glass in the National Cathedral. Now, 7 years later, I want to return to DC to create the next dimension of my artwork... a 3-dimensional installation which offers a new way of looking at Pop Art iconography and its place in American culture.My visit will take place during the 2016 College Art Association conference where I'm volunteering, giving me a chance to network with new art school graduates and professors and get inspired by their art stories. I'll also be attending numerous museums as well as taking a private tour of 5 artists' studios, offered by CAA.I've always been interested in the physical, material qualities of artworks and I enjoy pushing the boundaries with my own installations, such as the 24 canvases hanging from the ceiling in my museum show in Poland, The Magic City at Stara Kopalnia. The piece created from Pop(2) will also be unique, utilizing a never-before-seen art display technique. The piece consists of a large number of my Magic Blox, thick, imaged acrylic crystals, arranged in a 3-dimensional matrix which can be hung and experienced from all sides. Project backers get access to my exclusive updates and photos of the process of making the work.There's a physical presence to it... You have to involve your body in partaking in the artwork -- and that's unusual for photography. To me, this second level of participation beyond just the visual aspect goes a long way toward expressing what I want to say in these pieces... which is that there are other dimensions and ways of viewing everything. Check out this video of my museum installation at Stara Kopalania in Poland and you'll see what I mean. The presentation is part of the art:Magic Blox are 4x6"" acrylic blocks that are 1"" thick. A metalized print of my artwork is visible not only from the front but also from sides, giving Magic Blox a dimensionality and physicality that makes them ideal for taking photographs off the wall and into 3D space.My art consists of multiple exposure photographyŒæwhich is made in a camera. Multiple exposures are a classic, film based technique which require me to previsualize the scene before I shoot it. There is no way to see the two images combined until after they are taken, so the art comes in composing the shots -- as it does with any other kind of photograph. My goal with this technique is to push the boundaries of what can be done with the camera as a tool.The completed piece will be offered for museum display and also for sale. Project backers will have the first chance to purchase the completed installation."
329," So...I was cleaning out my laundry room today and found 108,000 toothpicks. These are vestiges of a former life, it seems. A life when my son was in grade school, I was a young, creative single mother, and the idea of aggregating a million of anything seemed so logical and possible.ŒæI managed to move this haul of toothpicks to a new house many years ago and curse their presence often for taking up a lot of space in my laundry room, but I never got rid of them. My son grew up, and a year ago, on January 26, 2015, he died from the complications of a bone marrow transplant at the unfair age of 15.ŒæFinding the toothpicks today during an earnest attempt to cure my laundry room of the scourge of looking like a scene from ""Hoarders,"" I couldn't bring myself to throw them out, and could only see one end for these 108,000 toothpicks. They should see their fate as a part of a million. I should see this idea through.ŒæAs an investor, your first question should be why you would fund the acquisition of a million of something just for the heck of it, and for some sad lady who doesn't clean her laundry room often enough. I have given this a lot of thought, and here is why.ŒæSince my son died, I have begun volunteering at Transitions Life Care (formerly Hospice of Wake County) and at the Duke Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Unit (where my son spent the last 5 months of his life). I quit my fairly lucrative job as an editor and have returned to graduate school to study Clinical Mental Health Counseling, with the intent of being a bereavement and end-of-life counselor. I learned a lot from my son's life, and his death.ŒæI want to help people and teach people and hold people up when they are facing what will always be the biggest fear and sorrow of humankind. When the worst has happened and they are faced with that deafening silence of loss, I want to say something that will keep them holding on a little while longer, until it hurts just a little bit less. And then I want to keep being there to share the road. For those who are leaving, I want to be someone who has watched it happen, almost as if in slow motion, and let them know that it's not so scary after all. It's a little shift we all have to make, we all do it, and I am honored to be there for that shift.ŒæHaving a million toothpicks in a somewhat portable medium is meaningful. It was to me so many years ago when I just had a vague desire to see it, but now I understand how this can be transformational and helpful to so many people. The neurons we have in our brains number in the millions, and each of these has created a neural pathway to another neuron to create a thought, an idea, a memory. Our very consciousness, as bewildering as it remains, is somewhere in the lightning between these millions of neurons. In fact, we have millions of memories of our lives from beginning to end, of those we have loved, and thoughts of everything we had always meant to say or do. One million is a small number to estimate these things, but can you imagine seeing it? Saying to a dying patient or a bereaved relative, ""This is one million toothpicks. That is the number of memories and loves you have. Look at that one million and see everything.""The average person only lives 27,500 days, which seems so small compared to a million! And it is. People amass a million dollars, but no one can amass a million days here. To actually SEE a million is to get closer to understanding the intricacies of our skin cells, grains of sand, or stars in the universe. It's just one small visual aid, but I think it could be a great feast for the eyes and the brain in the attempt to understand what this is all about.I can get about 62,500 toothpicks for about $50. If you know of a better toothpick deal, feel free to just send me the toothpicks and no money. You can ship them to:Colleen Lennon1209 N King Charles RdRaleigh, NC Œæ27610Thank you all!"
330," Have you ever experienced heartbreak? Heartbreak can be a life changing experience and one which we must share in order to get past our pain and move forward.ŒæIn November 2015 I experienced heartbreak, the agonising pain of losing the person you thought was the one, the person you thought you would spend the rest of your life with.ŒæAs a result of this experience I realised that I needed a lot of support and love if I was going to be able to get through this hard time. So I thought I would try and raise money to set up a heartbreak support lodge for others in a similar situation.A place that anyone could access for support whenever they needed it, to help get them through the hard times. Meet other people going through the same situation and share the love through this difficult time.ŒæHave a few laughs, share a few tears, through activities and events.ŒæTogether we can get through this!The support centre will work with continued contributions for members that come to the lodge, people can donate as much as they can afford.Œæ"

332," Each year at Burning Man, countless unique, unrepeatable, community-driven things happen, things that, once you experience them, often stay in your heart or mind forever. And every year is different. New things happen, or old things happen in new ways. Itäó»s why so many of us go year after year, and itäó»s one of the things that make each burn so magical and unique.ŒæFor many burners, nothing is more magical and unique than the Temple. At the Temple, the people of the playa collaborate with a dedicated physical space in authentic human spirit and love, in pain and sorrow at times, and ultimately in healing, hope and release.ŒæBy virtue of this mystic interaction of spirit and space, the Temple is the only large-scale structure that is authentically co-created by the artists and the people of the playa, as they interact with the Temple throughout the burn. To put it another way, no other artifact of the annual event so thoroughly absorbs, synthesizes, transmutes and expresses the hearts and souls of the particular spiritual beings at that particular yearäó»s burn.ŒæWhen the Temple burns on Sunday, itäó»s a release and closure. As it should be.ŒæEach year, though we let the Temple and everything it means to us rise smoky into the vastness of the night, thereäó»s value in remembering, in memorializing Temples past, for the architectural wonders that they were, for the artistry and effort that brilliant, inspired people put into creating each one, and also for the spiritual spaces that the people of the playa created within and around them.ŒæRemembering Temples past is the objective of The Temple Memory Project.ŒæThe Temple Memory Project 2016: What It is and What Itäó»s NotŒæThe Temple Memory Project 2016 is a relatively small exhibit to be placed at the Temple Guardian Camp during the burn. Itäó»s being designed and built by a volunteer team of people from the Temple Guardian Camp. The project grows organically out of past efforts at the Temple Guardian Camp to display images of the past Temples, including the large banners that were printed and hung on our training structure in 2015. We believe that a standalone structure for The Temple Memory Project will provide a better display and will better engage the community in the exhibit content.ŒæThe Temple Memory Project 2016 exhibit consists of walls that display printed images of the 15 past Temples, along with images of people interacting with past Temples. In the center of the exhibit will be a small theatre where there will be displayed slideshows and video from Temples past. If we can arrange it, there may also be a few artifacts from past Temples on display in cases around the exhibit.ŒæThe entire structure will fit in a footprint of 24 feet by 24 feet and stands 8 feet tall. It will be sturdy enough to withstand playa weather conditions and will generate no moop. It is powered by a solar generator system.ŒæŒæHere is a sketch diagram of the exhibit structure:ŒæThatäó»s what it is. Itäó»s also important to note that The Temple Memory Project is not officially affiliated with or funded by the official Burning Man organization, any official Temple builders camp or organization (past or present), or the official Temple Guardians organization.ŒæThis project is simply a Temple Guardian Camp effort, in terms of its official management. We will not be representing it as anything else. However, weäó»d be happy to receive assistance from any or all of the above-mentioned organizations, including any of the items listed below in the äóìHow You Can Helpäó section below.ŒæAbove all, weäó»re trying to keep our effort manageable in 2016. äóìKeep it doable,äó is our motto.ŒæHow You Can HelpŒæThis project currently needs funding to help us make it a reality. Ideally, we will need to raise about $8,000.00 to cover materials and equipment, but we can do a minimal setup with a minimum of $2,000. It won't be as cool, so we're hoping we get closer to the $8,000. The bulk of this cost will be for high-resolution output and mounting of the photographic panels. Solar power system, video projector and lighting are also significant costs.ŒæWe also will need volunteers to help set up and maintain the exhibit during the burn; we expect that Temple Guardian Camp members will help here too.ŒæThe project also needs material assistance in the form of the following:Œæäó¢	High-resolution images of Temples past, at all stages (pristine, during the burn, burning)Œæäó¢	High-quality video footage of Temples past at all stages, including any documentaries, builder interviews, raw footage, personal expressions, etc.Œæäó¢	Any material artifacts (or images thereof) from past Temple builders, including sketches, notebooks, scale models, etc.ŒæIf youäó»re a past Temple creator, we would love to hear from you, especially if you would be willing to come to the exhibit during the burn and give a talk on your experience designing and building your Temple.ŒæWe would also welcome any assistance in promoting the project, so that people who are interested can contribute and/or simply visit the exhibit during the burn. This may include social media sharing, telling friends or whatever helps get the word out.ŒæContact UsŒæCurrently, there are two people leading this effort.ŒæEek Maus will be coordinating the physical construction of the exhibit and its generally production and maintenance. He is also the treasurer. Email eek at ekingsbury@cox.net.ŒæEden will be collecting and coordinating the imagery and artifacts associated with the exhibit, as well as scheduling any events or talks associated with it during the burn.

335," After spending 10 years giving away art and months holding free art days at his home, Adrian Wilson decided last summer to do the impossible: open a store that didn't sell anything.From that simple idea, The Inutilious Retailer was born. It was created to remind people that buying things doesn't make anyone happy, that a hobby is something important in life and that everyone enjoys making art.The front part of the store is black and white, lit by a giant barcode. In the middle of the store is a slot machine from 1929, the start of the aptly named Great Depression, on a school desk.There are colorful clothes hanging on umbrellas that are free if anyone wants them but first they have to pull the slot machine handle. The reels are blank, signifying the futility of our working lives, though if the customer uses his imagination to describe what might be on the reels, a wall mirror swings open and the customer is invited into the secret workshop behind the wooden wall.There are only two conditions to get the garment, after all nothing is ever free. Firstly they have to agree to use a new garment, paint and printing blocks to create art on a new piece of clothing to replace it. Secondly, they must agree to be photographed so that they will find out which random person made what they picked and which random person will pick what they replace it with.The customer then spends as long as they want in the privacy of the workshop. They are shown how to use the 100 year old hand made stamps but never judged on what they make. There is no right and no wrong. Phones are switched off so that nobody is disturbed and the customer has to use their imagination to describe their experience to their friends.The store also has a secret courtyard garden where every wall has been covered in street art by Adrian Wilson's fellow street artist friends.There are around 300 people who have wandered into the store and found what has been compared to Narnia, Oz or Willy Wonka's. Originally planned only to be open from September 1st to January 1st, single parent Wilson has continued to 100% fund the project from his own pocket ever since. The landlord even lowered the rent by 20% to help keep the store open.The Inutilious Retailer won a prestigious Retail Design Institute Store of the Year award a few months ago, with a special category created for the first time in 45 years of awards. In order not to spoil the surprise element, Wilson only allowed one newspaper to cover the whole store and workshop and that was because The Guardian was founded in 1821 in Manchester by a textile merchant who would have used the same printing blocks.The store has become a big part of the local Lower East Side community, contrasting with the gentrification of the area by the arrival of high end galleries and ever increasing rents. As well as supporting street artists with free and legal places to create, the store has held events and gallery takeovers to provide a forum for the graffiti community.The store's value is in it's ability to inspire everyone who comes inside. In a city designed to make money, a free store makes no sense but it makes complete sense to everyone who experiences it.ŒæWhen your grandmother knitted you a hat or sweater every winter, you didn't ask how much the wool cost or suggest she make a business out of selling more, you just accepted it. The payment for both of you was unconditional love.We all need reminding sometimes that we should sometimes do things just for the sake of it.ŒæEven open a store that sells nothing.Unfortunately, I have run out of funds to keep it going, so I am asking for your help to keep the only store in the world that has a permanent ""100% OFF"" sale from closing down."

With an emphasis on activist and avant-garde art, EmergingCollective aims to catapult the most promising creatives to the forefront ofthe global art scene, and serve as a cultural change-agent for the nextgeneration.HOW IT WORKSThe program consistsof a dual artist-in-residency program and a collaborative exhibition äóñ one globallyrecognized artist and one top emerging talent. One of these artists will comefrom the first world, and the other will come from the emerging markets. Thementorship relationship will be solidified in their collaboration.First, they will create a piece inthe disused space chosen. The creative process will be live streamed, and thework will be on auction from the moment the work begins, ending when the workis complete. They will also collaborate on an immersive concept andbuild it together.

338," jack-prendergast.comI am determined to re-stage and expand the original installation I created over the past two years, building it to full scale, combining previous elements and many new ones.Œæ I would like to get as many people as possible involved and coming along to the opening night or one of the exhibition days.Œæ The exhibition will be held in London hopefully in June next year.Œæ ŒæŒæ The stained glass artworks are completed, and are in storage in my studio.Œæ The goal is to take them out of storage and display them in a suitable exhibition space, and perhaps also tour them around in a truck so that the installation can be seen more widely (have a look below at my model!).Œæ Imagine seeing the work in a supermarket car park late at night, by the coast, or high up on a mountain.ŒæŒæ I have also begun work designing the next installation and can't wait to start work on it.Œæ I am really exited by this new project, but can't say too much at this stage; but it also involves glass artworks, photography, painting and metalwork.Œæ The other goal of this Kickstarter project is to get this new work under way.In this work I was inspired by Aztec and Native American art, comics, folklore and motel signs.Who am I?My name is Jack Prendergast, I am 23 and work in London as an artist.Œæ I recently graduated from City and Guilds of London Art School, having studied there for four years.Œæ I completed a painting and fine arts degree, which also involved a great deal of etching and printmaking.Œæ I began working with glass about two years ago.Œæ Photography and metalwork are also important elements in my work.Œæ I am currently working with photography and combining this with audio.Œæ Have a listen to my lovely friend Sandy talk about her life living in the Arizona desert with her five awesome dogsIn these two works I looked at food, gun culture and Aztec symbolsSeveral years ago a few friends and I drove across North America in a $700 Cadillac (it broke down 8 times).Œæ I loved the trip and was fascinated by the variety in the landscape, people, architecture, and wildlife, amongst other things.Œæ From place to place there were some striking contrasts, in particular the divide between the wealthy and the poor.I met many amazing people, who revealed so many different aspects of this vast nation.Œæ Having documented my journey with photos, audio recordings and drawings I decided to build an art installation.Œæ I wanted to encapsulate the experiences I'd had and the places I'd explored. Œæ Œæ Œæ Having returned to London, I was not sure of the best material to convey my ideas.Œæ I decided to sign up for evening classes in glass work and was soon making stained glass windows using medieval techniques.Œæ My stained glass teacher Carey was brilliant and very inspiring.Œæ I suggested to her that I build a Chapel in which I could record my impressions of America.Œæ She gave me enormous support and encouragement.I did not want the glass pieces to appear like traditional church stained glass, so I looked at old motel signs, Aztec art and patterns, Native American art, video game graphics, arcade machines, gas pumps, comic books, wildlife, art deco buildings and wild landscapes, amongst many other things.Œæ After many weeks at the drawing board, I came up with four key designs (see below).Motels are everywhere in the United States.Œæ They are fascinating places; the architecture, the signs, their strange histories, and the sense of not knowing who has been in your room before you.Œæ I stayed in a particular motel in Memphis which someone had reviewed with - ""I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy"".Œæ  In my installation the viewer goes through the Gastly Motel room and then into the glass Chapel.Œæ ŒæWhy Kickstarter?I want to reach out to as wide a range of people as possible from many different countries and I think this is best method.Œæ Hopefully, through using Kickstarter, many different people will get to see the project and share the experience.Œæ ŒæŒæ Your support will help expand and re-stage the original project and also get my next project off the ground.When I had the chance to install the Gastly Motel and Chapel the first time, the available space was not large enough to allow for a full installation, which would have included a double motel room with bathroom.Œæ I was only able to use the space briefly.Œæ Your support will enable me to develop my ideas further and on a larger scale.Œæ Here is what the funds would go towards:For the new project the funds would go towards:I believe it is crucial that supporters receive interesting rewards for getting involved.Œæ I have structured these to be as affordable and varied as possible, so that there is something for everyone.Œæ Have a look below to see examples of my work and the rewards being offered.Everyone who can come to the opening in London will also be able to try a slice of my apple pie.Limited edition etchingsBelow are examples of limited edition etchings available as rewards.Œæ I have been etching for four years now and have learned a huge amount about all aspects of the process in the etching department at City and Guilds.Œæ I recently had some of my prints (shown below) on display at the Royal Academy print fair in London.Œæ The series of prints I am working on at the moment are about folklore, animals, gun culture and food.Œæ Below are examples of my previous etchings... new work is under way! Here is how they are madeEtching is a very old form of printing, involving rolling wax across a metal plate.Œæ The artist draws an image into the wax, and then uses acid to erode a groove into the line.Œæ This groove allows ink to be rolled into it, which can then be printed using an etching press, as shown below.Œæ Rembrandt and Goya were both innovators in their styles of etching, I highly recommend having a look at their etchings if you haven't already seen them. Œæ Œæ Here are some close ups which show a bit more detailŒæWhy do guns feature in my work During my travels throughout the United States I became familiar with the gun culture.Œæ While I was there the Colorado Cinema Shooting took place, revealing the devastating and tragic impact that guns can have in the wrong hands. Here is a selection of photographs that I took on my travels throughout the US.Œæ The quality of these images has had to be reduced for copyright protection, but all the photographic prints offered as rewards will be supplied in high resolution and will be printed at optimum quality on the highest quality paper.Œæ They will all be signed on the back with a thank you message.Œæ Photographs are available in different sizes, please look in the reward section to find out more. Œæ ŒæThere are also more images on my website -Œæ jack-prendergast.comBelow are examples of my monoprint paintings.Œæ These are made by painting images on to metal and then running them through the etching press.Œæ This creates a certain texture in the print. Œæ These are one-offs, not editions like the etchings, and they will also be signed.If you were wondering how the glass artworks in the Chapel were made this explanation may help.The Chapel is made up of 22 glass pieces mounted in wooden light boxes and surrounded by 42 light bulbs housed in wooden structures.Œæ Once I had designed the pieces, I handmade each one, using the same techniques as medieval stained glass makers.Œæ The glass was cut and shaped to size, then joined together using lead and solder.Œæ Once joined together I used a black stained putty to enhance the structure and provide waterproofing.For the imagery I used the technique of glass painting, a method that has been used for hundreds of years.Œæ A lead-based pigment is ground down and then water and gum Arabic are used to create a paste/liquid.Œæ This liquid is then painted on to the glass and left to dry.Œæ Once this stage is finished you begin drawing.Œæ I have had various inspirations for the imagery, including folktales, video game graphics, comic books and Aztec symbols.Œæ When each drawing is finished the glass is fired in a kiln at 600 degrees, setting the material into the glass so that it becomes permanent.Œæ The light boxes were all handmade by myself in a carpentry workshop and have strip lighting for illumination.Œæ My friend David was hugely helpful when making the boxes.If you got down this far, thanks so much!

340," Who are we?:Ghost Magnet Roach Motel is a Punkformance outfit from the borderlands of Tijuana, Mexico. This International Sound Collective consists of 2 Mexican visual artists, 1 Japanese performance artist and 2 American punk-musicians. We have been generating these pro-active art projects for the past 10 years, and this spring we have an opportunity to make a big installation ""THE COCKROACH EFFECT""ŒæŒæin 2 important music festivals - NRMAL Festival in Mexico City, and South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas.ŒæWhat is the project?: INSTALLATION / PUNKFORMANCEThe ROACH MOTEL (stage-installation), a 20 x 40 foot sculpture constructed from scaffolding, vinyl and other paraphernalia for will become our stage forŒæTHE COCKROACH EFFECT tourŒæ, that offers the public the chance to penetrate the boundaries between stage and audience by letting them crawl and interact through the passages of the ROACH MOTEL while GMRM punkforms throughout NRMAL and SXSW.THE ROACH MOTEL (3D model):ŒæMaterial specifications (ROACH MOTEL):Modular scaffolding will be used as the skeleton of the structure, covered by transparent, translucent and solid color vinyl; we will use wood plank platform floors, and LED lighting throughout the sculpture. The ROACH MOTEL permits the audience to travel though the ""installation-stage-tunnel"" that will be converted into a sound and light passage way that constantly emits the audio-recordings and live punkformances that GMRM will produce at each festival.ŒæThere will be video projectors strategically located inside and outside the structure and a large megaphone will be placed on The ROACH MOTELŒÇs tower that will be used to ""alarm"" the audience that the Punkformance is in process.What is PUNKFORMANCE?:ŒæWe have been developing PUNKFORMANCE for the past several years, mostly showing in museum and gallery settings for a selected few. Now we look to punkform in bigger venues and to the wider audiences, knowing that the de-contextualization of the ""expected concert experience"" creates paths to different forms of perception and content interaction. What is improvisation to others is sacred to us, the act of creating sound and circumstance onsite can revamp what is usually a safe and viewer friendly experience, we offer something totally different.some previous examples:Durring the self-titled punkformance at ICBC in 2010, we appropriated the whole gallery space with the projects name painted in huge white on black letters. We punkformed for three straight Fridays, deconstructing the space (painting over parts of the letters and destroying parts of the wall), placing open mics around the gallery for audience interventions and literally flooding the floors with tap water and infesting the space with live crickets we bought in a pet store.Our ""Loosing Face in Beijing Tour"" happened inside a centuriesŒæold former ToaistŒætemple in the middle of old Beijing, China. In a deep collaboration with Chinese Opera trained vocalist Fenni, Japanese performance artist Meguni Shimizu and French Photo and Video Artist Olivier Modr, we plugged into a tradition of historical self reliance and introspection methods that make sound and noise through collective energies; proving that foreign dose not mean distant nor diferent, only unknown until present. This wasnŒÇt the first time we punkformed without all the ""members"" physically present, we use p2p video and audio chat applications to shorten distances when we are not in the same room...ŒæFor ALL MY FRIENDS Music Festival in Rosarito Mí©xico, we realized the power of the Punkformance in the ""music festival scene"". We built on site sculpture for the festival stage that became the ""orb of oddness and unique beauty"" for a more conventional one band in one band out music festival structure.ŒæThis has been a dream project for all of the members, Shinpei Takeda, Daniel Ruanova, Tony Cozano, Julio Orozco, and Brian Sweda, all of whom have been seeking this new way of expressing ourselves that is beyond what is considered art and music. We want to provide something that is not POP, and yet something that invigorates the cockroach effect inside of each of us.ŒæWho is Ghost Magnet Roach Motel?: ""aŒæNEO-GLOBAL/POST-MEDIUM/SOUND-GENERATING/ARTIST-COLLECTIVE""From TIJUANA, MEXICO:ŒæJULIO OROZCOŒæPHOTOGRAPHER/ VISUAL ARTIST, his pieces that border the notion of history, narrative, nostalgia and cultural identity have been exhibited in various places in Mexico, USA and Europe; Met Room Foundation (Barcelona Spain) Nowy Theater(Warsaw, Polonia) Kunst Raum H&H (Koln, GermanyŒæ(official website:Œæhttp://julio-orozco.tumblr.com/)ŒæDANIEL RUANOVAŒæVISUAL ARTIST, creates a variety of objects, images and situations that encourage the public/viewer to re-think their own position on äóìeveryday politics of aesthetics,äó usually focusing on the pleasures that meaningless violence and aggression create in overindulged societies.

341," Important update:1Iäó»ve been asked if this gallery is for my art or for othersart as well. Please let me emphasize that this is so very much not about myart. I will focus most of my personal art sales to art fairs and online.Œæ I primarily want to open this gallery for theartistäó»s in this immediate area. And there are many amazing artists aroundhere. I believe they should have a place to show their unique talents. I want(with your kind and generous help) to open thatŒæplace for them to let their artworks shine!Important Update:2This isnäó»t just a business opportunity for meäó_ this is formy community. We are the gateway to the beautiful and historical Mount LoopHighway. Iäó»d love to give those who would normally just pass through anotherreason to stop and check out our wonderful little mountain town. Iäó»m enamoredwith this town and its environment and people. I want the gallery and myself tobe able to participate in the fairs, benefits and parades that help make this afun and community driven place to live and visit.Important Update:3I've been asked if this will be a non-profit or will it becommission based.Œæ The plan is to startas a commission based gallery and start figuring out our options as we (theartistäó»s and I) decide what is best for sales and the community at large. Themajority of the funds collected through this campaign are for one yearäó»s rent,utilities, insurances (including theft and liability), overhead and spot lightinstallation, building and buying wall mounts, ceiling mounts, locking displaycases and shelving. A portion also goes to shipping, painting supplies,canvases, scanning, printing and the other items and services needed to fulfillmy rewards obligations.I have fallen in love with this quiet, little mountain townthat is the gateway to the stunningly beautiful Mount Loop Highway (Google it,but donäó»t blame me if you then decide to sell all you own and move here). Wehave the necessities and moreäó_ Supermarket, restaurants (Chris Pratt hung outat the pizza joint across the street during his high school days), hair salons,a dance studio, hardware store, parks, nice schools and a wonderful sense ofcommunity. What we donäó»t have is a place for local artists to display and selltheir art.ŒæI have been painting in a little studio right smack in thecenter of downtown. Adjacent to my studio is an open space with lots of naturallight and just big enough (approx. 35äó»x25äó») to display quite a few pieces ofartwork. The store front is mostly windows and is perfect for showcasing all the different types of unique artworks created by our fantastically talented Northwest artists. Including jewelry, blown glass, original paintings, sculpture and anything creative and beautiful that will fit in the space. It is on the main thoroughfare with lots of traffic from locals,tourists and those passing through town.ŒæI will have my Grand Opening no later than May 1st,but the reality is we should be open and running by April 1st. Therewards will be shipped out ASAP. As soon as the prints are printed, the shirtsare made by hand, the paintings promised are painted etc., all will be safelypacked and out the door as quick as I can. It will be as much a priority as openingthe gallery.The $33,000 Iäó»m trying to raise will pay for a full yearäó»srent, insurance and utilities. It will cover the costs for art mountinghardware, locking display cases, shelving, lighting, and any flooring andpainting that will be needed. I was a building maintenance supervisor beforerediscovering my artistic talents and will be doing the majority of the workmyself. My wife is an office manager and is helping with the budget anddetails. A portion of the funds will be used to cover the cost of the prints,coloring books, t-shirts, shipping, etc., for your contributor rewards. A smallamount of the funds will be apportioned for canvases, paint, and othernecessities that will help color the world and make it a little more beautifultoday than it was yesterday.

342," Aspect 1- äóìLive Artäó» Event Painting- This is the expression of an event or atmosphere where the artist interacts with everyone and everything going on and paints äóìLiveäó the feelings, emotions,  colors and images onto a canvas for all to see. This style is usually not a main performance but done with other headline acts or done covertly to merely paint the specific event: wedding reception, party, birthday, special event, concert, etcäó_ŒæŒæThis is the main painting done for a full 3-Day Event in Jan. 2012. This was the Tri-Cities Sportsmen Show and there are 12 things hidden inside this painting. ŒæClose-up showing some hidden things in the Sportsmen Show painting.... Here are 4 things to look for... 19th, Archery, Merle, & Bev....are all hidden in the close-up above ....have fun!ŒæŒæThis is the smaller personal painting created for the promoters of the Sportsmen Show using their company logo.ŒæAspect 2 The addition of names; logos; dates; ages; anniversaries; places; and/or images etc.that are painted and specifically hidden inside the painting. They are placed  with varying degrees of difficulty for people to then have to find. Some will require the need to get within inches to be able to find- kind of like whereäó»s Waldo but whereäó»s your momma?? Or whereäó»s your doggy? Where's your company name or logo?ŒæThis was done during a 2 hour ""Live Art"" event at Avalon Retirement in Pasco, WA. I did an additional 8 hours placing the hidden objects and doing final touch ups.ŒæAspect 3- äóìLive Artäó Interactive Event Painting- This is where the artist interacts with everyone  and everything going on  and incorporates the suggestions/ideas of those at the event into the painting. This style is also done as primarily a main performance, staged and directed by myself and those present. Every event  creates its own dynamic depending  on those  who choose to engage in helping me create and design an original painting äóìLiveäó. During this style I am writing down the suggestions and names of those who are mainly engaged in helping to create the painting along with me. Then once the 2 to 3 hour event is over I will spend another approx. 7 to 12 hours placing the hidden objects, text, or images and doing all final additions and touch ups to the painting.I quote äóìLive Artäó because there is a three  fold äóìLiveäó aspect to my style of paintings that no other event painters incorporate.The first äóìliveäó aspect is the literal painting äóLiveäó at the actual event as it is taking place for all to watch. This is what all event painters create.The second äóìLiveäó aspect is an element Iäó»ve designed to add to my style. It is a never ending and ongoing äóìLiveäó  interaction with hidden images placed into my event paintings. I tactically hide images, names, logos, dates,  and other information for people to be challenged to find.  Some are seen easily, while  others will require individuals to literally get within inches to find .The third aspect that I am currently doing is a NEW and  unique style of äóìLive Artäó event painting that I have not found being done by anyone but myself. I am currently  preparing to launch these new styles.There is also one more additional element that I plan to add to my events- all original music written and recorded by myself.  I have been a keyboard player/musician for 24+ years also. This music will be played in the background as I perform each event. I also am working on how to incorporate my live art and music done together..ŒæKickstarter Thank You Poster......Rewards InformationWith the success of this project I will create a large 24x30 Poster to be displayed  at my all my Events/Performances. There will be 3 main categories of partners: Supporters, Sponsors,  and Benfactors. A huge Thank You and a brief explanation of the success of our  KickStarter  Project will headline the poster. Sponsor and Benefactor partners will be highlighted in a special  section. I will also mention all Benefactor partners individually at my äóÖLiveäó Events during live performances. Throughout the year I will be hopefully doing a number of additional engagements with the KickStarter partners that will have the poster on display as well.

Œæhttp://facebook.com/iheartdenverstoreI Heart Denver Store started as a special pop-up store project with 24 local artists in a vacant retail space during a Denver city program called Create Denver Week. That week-long store led to a lot of press, excitement on social media, and great sales for the artists.ŒæBecause of the great response to the pop-up store and the amount of vacant space in the city during the recession, we were able to work with the owners of Denver Pavilions, a shopping center on the 16th Street Mall, to get short-term leases for more pop-up stores. After 3 more pop-up store experiences, we were ready to create the permanent store that we operate now.ŒæThe permanent location has been in operation since April 2011, and has sold millions of dollars in local merchandise. It has been an exciting experience to help promote Denver and Colorado's creative scene, which is a major part of the success the state has seen in growth. We meet people from all over the world every day, helping them find something special to bring back to friends and family.ŒæVisit our website to find more info about our program and how it works: www.iheartdenverstore.com/aboutSamuel Schimek- Store owner and the innovator behind the I Heart Denver Store program.

349," An integer overflow is a numeric value represented outside the capable range of a given number of bits. Overflow conditions return incorrect results when the outcome is not anticipated. The unpredictability of overflow outcomes can therefore compromise the reliability of a program.What if some conspiracy theories are true? What if the human desire to uncover the truth is actually an expression of societyäó»s drive to continually question and scrutinize itself? What if our obsession with curbing an integer overflow, in the lead-up to Y2K, helped us to avoid the very calamity we predicted? INTEGER OVERFLOW is the culmination of our research into the similarities between the disasters predicted to occur on January 1st, 2000 and those which did occur subsequent to November 8th, 2016. It is a thought experiment, with the intent to create and then immediately deconstruct a post-human aestheticäóîenvisioning what would emerge in the event of a technological singularity, a nuclear holocaust, or colonization by malignant extra-terrestrial (or subterranean) overlords. It is both a celebration and an indictment of our culture of fantastical reasoning, responsible for the greatest achievements of human creativity and also our pathological resistance to facts, rationality, and logic. The works in the exhibition explore the tales, truths, and taboos surrounding some of the most gripping conspiracies of our generation, questioning ideas about post-American life, protection, scarcity, and consensus reality.Our research will be collected and displayed in a gallery exhibition tentatively scheduled to open on December 15, 2017 featuring works from a variety of media (sculpture, painting, drawing, video, performance, and a life-size doomsday bunker)."
350," 'Suspended' is a continuation of 'Flight', which hung in St Jamesäó»s Piccadilly over Christmas 2015 seeking to highlight the humanitarian crisis of forced displacement across the world.Two years later, thousands more refugees have continued to flee war, persecution and famine for the safety of European shores, deepening what has become the worst humanitarian crisis since WW2. Whilst Europe struggles to come to terms with this, human trafficking networks are becoming brutally efficient at exploiting and making profit from the vulnerability of migrants. As a war artist, Suspended is my response to the deepening refugee crisis.This installation, which will comprise hundreds of garments of clothing discarded by refugees on their arrival to Europe, is a direct sequel to Flight. Like Flight, this installation will address the global policies affecting the future of every refugee. In so many cases, these refugees are stuck; they cannot return to their countries, but they cannot move forward into a future they urgently need and deserve. This is especially poignant when it comes to young people, who face an uncertain future fraught with discontent and run the subsequent risk of human trafficking, slavery, and radicalisation.Suspended will hang in St Jamesäó»s Piccadilly for 2 months over the Christmas period and then transfer to New York City, where it will be exhibited in Trinity Church Wall Street, during Lent & Easter.Œæ"

Talladega county and the city derives its name and land from a part of the Creek Indian nation.ŒæFor you sports fans, Talladega is where the initial Œæconception of Auburn University and Birmingham-Southern College began. The world famous Talladega Super Speedway is a short drive from the city,  Check out the Talladega Walk of Fame Davey Allison Memorial Park located directly behind the Old City Hall building.ŒæNearby Talladega airport is believed by some to have been the site of the first powered heavier-than-air flight made by Lewis Archer Boswell before the Wright Brothers. ŒæIn 2002, the Talladega airport was renamed Boswell Field.The city is also home to Talladega College, the oldest liberal arts Historically Black CollegeŒæin the state, and home of the Armistad Murals that commemorate significant events in African American history.ŒæThe oldest continuously operated court house in Alabama is the central focus of the nearby Talladega Court House Square Historic District which isŒæ listed on the National Register of Historic Places.ŒæŒæThis District is centrally located and covers a two block radius in any direction.The Ritz Theater is another focal point in the historic district.  The theater, with its äóìvitroliteäó glass panels is one of the oldest theaters in the U.S. in continuous use.The Old City Hall building along with the nearby Silk Stocking District and Talladega College Historic District are all located in the city of Talladega and are within a half mile of each other.Œæ . These combined historic areas all support the Talladega Court House Square Historic District making the entire area a must see historic destination.The Old City Hall building is located within 1-2 blocks of these historic places.ŒæŒæTheŒæbuilding was initially planned by the Talladega City Council around 1874. The engineer and designer was City Engineer E. H. Walpole.ŒæIn 1890, the city contracted with B.H. Clardy & Sons to build a structure that äóìwould be suitable for the conduct of the publicäó»s businessäó. Œæ Official records show the building project was financed by ""security bonds from New York City"". ŒæŒæOld City Hall was the headquarters and focal point of Talladega city government for many years. It was later sold and the city moved its operation to a more modern building.ŒæOld City Hall is a beautiful structure consisting of two levels with a grand front entrance staircase to the second floor. Completed and dedicated in 1892 as inscribed on the cornerstone, the architecture is Dutch Flemish. ŒæThe front facade has several bas relief scrolls, gargoyles, and other carvings. There is a stone carving on the upper front facade rumored to be the work Œæof Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti who designed the Vulcan statute in Birmingham, AL. ŒæMoretti is known to have carved many statues for use as grave markers in area cemeteries.Additionally, local stories claim there is a picture or carving on the front of the building depicting slaves working in the cotton fields.Œæ At some point protest from local citizens resulted in the picture being covered.Œæ Looking up you can see a metal like cover on the building.Œæ What's under the cover is somewhat of a mystery.The building has four different but joined roofs.  The peak of which are the two towers with distinct architectural scrolls and carvings.  Unfortunately in the 1970s, many buildings around the square, including Old City Hall, front facades were covered with glass, plastic or aluminum in an attempt at modernization.  Over the years, the Old City Hall building was used for different retail businesses on the ground level.  The second floor, while not used in modern times, consists of several small rooms and a larger room reminiscent of a dance hall or ballroom. ŒæThese are the rooms that housed the city government.ŒæŒæIt is a marvelous space, but like the rest of the building, is in need of repair.ŒæSo now the task at hand is to restore this building, to shore up the structure, make it functional and restore it'soriginal appearance as much as possible.

The third module takes us to an environment linked to us, staging our limitations outside the prison space through sculptures that adhere to the walls.

The first thing I did was find a place that was willing to host it, so I bothered a lot of people, and eventually Lotherton hall agreed to have it set up in their estate. Then I found a sculptor whoäó»s created similar projects before, together we worked out the budget of Œ£3300 for materials, workshop space, labour and transport; we immediately considered applying for arts funding.Then I thought, because this is a project for everyone, I want everyone, or as many people as possible to be involved in making it. So I set up this kickstarter page.ŒæPeople have already ready gotten on board, because they can see that in a climate of cuts to art funding, this project will be another burst of colour in what can otherwise be a very dull world.Although thereäó»s been a lot of interest, we still have a long way to go and a short time to get there, so Iäó»m asking that you please give whatever you can towards this. No money will leave your account until the 22nd of January, and only if we reach the full target.Giving Œ£10 or more will let you engrave your name and a message on the instruments themselvesIt'll be your unchanging mark on something that sounds different on every visit.

We are both Architectural Designers based in Leicester, UK  and we have been working on this project for over a year now.Œæ ŒæPURGATORY is an architectural installation unmasking contemporary socio-political alternative reality. It has been created after thorough research in historical background, observation and participation in various civic affairs. ŒæPURGATORY is a rather inconspicuous structure from the outside and it surprises with an intricate journey on the inside. We are both very satisfied with the design and we feel strongly that everyone should experience it which is why we need your help!ŒæPURGATORY will be constructed in StudionAme in Leicester and first shared on 10th of February until 5th of March 2018 at Attenborough Arts Centre, University of Leicester, UK as part of DeStress Fest. ŒæWe received funding from Attenborough Art Centre which helped us with studio renting but we need quite a lot of money for materials as it is a 50 square metre structure!ŒæMATERIALS WE NEED:Furniture foam, MDF boards, structural timber posts, hard board sheets, spotlights, printing, black frames, mirror roll, spray mirror glue, black paint.ŒæIf we are successful PURGATORY will then tour to venues and outdoor public spaces, drawing upon and informed by audience feedback to fuel the second part of this installation which will be developed and delivered in later 2018.ŒæŒæŒæPURGATORY is our reaction to recent events in which media and politics are conflated. From the outside the installation looks like a large black room with a very small door. It leads into a dimly lit constricting corridor, forcing the participant to crawl and negotiate maze-like obstacles symbolically representing the constrictions imposed by authority and shared as riddles via the media.ŒæThe participant views posters with strong empowering messages in äóÖpropaganda-styleäó» on the walls of the maze. The posters are revealed in different lighting atmospheres and room sizes. Small openings offer views into unreachable spaces. The journey through the maze builds up tension, representing the feeling of gradually getting more and more lost in this reality. Finally, in the central space, the participant encounters an alternative reality. The space is well lit and the walls are covered with reflective material, in the middle stands a reflective box creating distorted reflections of the participant and their surroundings. Here, the participant can challenge pre-formed perceptions of body and senses and is forced to analyse this new perception, possibly as a mental confessional, a purging evoking clarity of perception. Upon exiting and returning to a world which is day lit and full of straight lines we expect the participant to evaluate everyday reality with a rediscovered scrutiny and freshly recalibrated senses.ŒæIs this place familiar?  ŒæIs this your reality?  ŒæPurgatory has reset you.ŒæŒæŒæŒæArchitectural design and concept: Lina Geseviciute and Anna Chorzepa Curator: G Sian (InkMilk) Special thanks to:ŒæG Sian (InkMilk) for curating our project and supporting us throughout,ŒæKishan (Zeropence) for being our camera man and spiritual guide,ŒæKajal Nisha Patel for allowing us to use her photography with Lina and Mette after Women's Protest in London.DJ Format and Sly5thave for giving us rights to use their wonderful music and endorsing our ideas!ŒæŒæ"

357," Hello friends and future pergola discussionors! The people pergola is a project focused on helping people come together under one roof! A pergola is an amazing way to create an intimate gathering space in an otherwise open world. Pergolas are a great place to put chairs and shield your eyes from blinding sun. My hope is to erect a Pergola like the one in the photo and then have our supporters come together for an intimate outdoor gathering to celebrate this work of art in the community of Green Bay, WI.  The pergola will be a way to invite neighbors in, friends, and other guests all who will share the pergola with us. Our pergola will measure 14äó» x 15äó» feet between posts and will be built out of Cedar. I will first dig some holes in the ground, and then add some concrete to create something called a footing.  The footings will have picture drawn in the concrete to represent the new beginnings, my wife and I will add our personal touches to the concrete with a paper clip and draw a decorate picture or two. Once footings are set, we will put up posts and continue building the people pergola from there. While the project is being built, we will continue to think about how it will draw people together in outdoor fellowship. Œæ Our goal is to create a gathering place for friends, family, kickerstarter people, kids, dogs, and anyone who appreciates the intimate setting of a pergola, and the design elements of stick construction.Œæ"

Its a non profit organization that promotes the generation of ideas and innovative practices, and international culture exchange.The 'Ace Residency Program is one of the major projects supported by the foundation. The program aims to promote contemporary artistic practices that use printmaking, photography, design, and new media to explore mutual hybridization, and multiple capacity though research, and production to promote the exchange, and discussion of collaborative work.ŒæDuring the residency I'll be using the 'Ace facilities to learn more about various printmaking methods, and incorporate my findings with my current artistic processes. I will create large scale immersive installations (public) that incorporate print, body movement, and fiber art.The money raised through Kickstarter will go toward:BASIC RESIDENCY FEE: US$2320INSTALLATION: US$ 600TECHNICAL/CURATORIAL ASSISTANCE: US$ 500SHARED LODGING: US$ 500Concept:I am aware of the space between the sky and the ground but I am more interested in the point of intersection- where these two things meet and how they actually connect. What is our role in this relationship?We sprout up from the ground, and walk this surface as if the earth beneath our feet is flat. There is infinite direction. A million courses jetting from the body attached to a series of labyrinthian grids. We weave our way through, solitary, and grounded, sharing our weight with the world- asking it to support us while we use it hoist ourselves up.There is always something at our feet. And at our feet we are each at the top of the world. Our world.As individuals we are grounded and independently responsible for our weight, and the placement of our bodies. What happens to this point of groundedness Œæwhen we collide with something or someone else- when the point beneath our feet shifts slightly to acknowledge another energy-when we confront each other with our weight. Is this intimacy?There is no bridge between us but we are aware of the space we take and that which we give.The nature of this relationship is intuitive, perceptive, sensitive, and understanding, because to shift the centrifugal point is both violent and tender. We ritualize this point through movement, space, weight, and the sharing of these things.***Video filmed and edited by Gleb MikhalevCurrent Work:"
360," This art installation grew out of my frustration with how issues around the environment are being handled.ŒæIf the interests of the environment are on one side, and the interests of money on the other, there seems to be an block that neither side can get past. Both sides counter each other with like for like: both have good arguments for and against; both have dedicated scientists that support their views; both seem to get no where in advancing change.ŒæHowever, I don't believe the money side needs to win. A draw is good enough. It keeps things the way they are. And money continues to advance, and the environment continues to suffer.Object 5, ""Let Earth Win"", picks up on this struggle. It uses the game board and play of naughts and crosses to describe what is happening and a solution. Naughts and crosses is a futile game. Between two skilled opponents the result should always be a draw. If we substitute environment for the naughts and money for the crosses, the result is the same. Two skilled opponents, playing the game, always result in a draw. The question is, ""Is that okay?""ŒæThe installation raises questions about arguments and power and ""winning"". Money (growth, wealth, greed) only needs a draw to keep winning. But the Earth will continue to lose while there is a draw. And nothing will change.ŒæThe only solution is for money to let earth win.ŒæHowever, I think it would be wrong to think of money as only corporations and big business. It starts with individuals, and the daily choices we make, and if we are able to let earth win.ŒæThis is the installation. A small handmade object, made out 100% recycled cardboard, using letterpress techniques to create a beautiful and simple game to engage with the issues around the environment. It is not a poster to rally the masses. It is a small object, 20cm by 20 cm, to engage two people at a time, and challenge us to think about our own responses to the environment and money and what we can do to make a change for the better."

363," The idea to create this mural popped into my head this morning when I woke up to more of the same ludicrous, asinine headlines that this excuse-of-a-president creates one after another after another after another after another.ŒæThe piece will be a series of large screen prints arranged like a mural. Like Warhol's soup cans, the individual images of trumf will be similar but also slightly different from one another. Each image will be selected based upon the emotional experience it invokes from the viewer. The mural as a whole is an image for our time, designed to appeal to those who have a desire to express the full range of their subtle emotions surrounding the events of today.Also, the mural is a physical, tangible item that can't be dismissed as ""fake"".

365," Somos un grupo de artistas de Chile, cuyo interí©s de realizar esta muestra de artes integradas PAISAJES TELí_RICOS en el ExConvento de Tepoztlíçn, radica en la similitud de ambos territorios, los cuales se encuentran demarcados por titíçnicas montaí±as, surgidas  de movimientos telí_ricos, de explosiones volcíçnicas, desplazamientos de placas, deslaves. Las montaí±as del Tepozteco en Mí©xico y la Cordillera de los Andes en Chile, tienen en comí_n ser lugares del cobre y  fueron considerados lugares sagrados y ceremoniales por nuestras culturas ancestrales y donde se concentra la sabidurí_a. Hasta la actualidad transmiten poderosas energí_as, sensaciones y emociones  para sus habitantes, constituyendo un fuerte referente del lugar. Así_ mismo, remitií©ndonos a las mitologí_as locales encontramos que las montaí±as tambií©n  estíçn relacionadas a los movimientos telí_ricos. Nos interesa retomar esta relacií_n en tanto paí_ses telí_ricos, pues el fení_meno nos sití_a en la incertidumbre reconstituyendo cada vez,  los trozos rotos, tanto fí_sicos, psicolí_gicos y culturales. Reconstruccií_n a partir de los fragmentos.Estas majestuosas masas montaí±osas, nos inspiran a la interpretacií_n artí_stica, desde las artes bidimensionales (plíçstica y video), las tridimensionales (esculturas e instalaciones), al movimiento (danza y performance).PAISAJES TELí_RICOS es una puesta en escena donde los artistas reinterpretamossimbí_licamente un terremoto, maremoto o erupcií_n volcíçnica como un signo de nuestratierra mater, desde donde surge la reflexií_n ancestral frente a la naturaleza, formando unespí_ritu de asociacií_n y colectividad creadora que en un juego de equilibrios y de fuerzasexpresan la manera de ver y habitar nuestro territorio.Como paí_ses telí_ricos el fení_meno nos plantea la reconstruccií_n una y otra vez de lostrozos rotos, fragmentos tanto fí_sicos como culturales y humanos.El objetivo es difundir nuestra obra personal, así_ como generar una nueva propuestacolectiva. Cada uno expondríç y trabajaríç con elementos propios de la naturaleza, recreandodesde lo histí_rico, geogríçfico y sensorial con interí©s en los mitos, ritos y danzasrepresentíçndolos en manifestaciones interdisciplinarias plíçsticas y audiovisuales,entrelazando un tejido desde lo particular, asociado con la comunidad, en torno a un temacomí_n y lenguajes disimiles reflejados en distintas disciplinas de las artes visuales:instalacií_n, dibujo, grabado, pintura, escultura, performance, video.Plíçsticamente incorporaremos conceptos relacionados con el tema, tales como:cambios, movimientos, fragmentos, estratos, capas, soplos, grietas y costras entre otros.Trabajaremos con materialidades como tierra, cuerpo, fibras naturales, minerales y sonidos.Usaremos sí_mbolos como la serpiente: Treng-Treng y KayäóñKay de la mitologí_a mapuche,creadores de la tierra y el Camahueto, creador de los temblores.En tí©rminos espirituales emerge a la superficie la divisií_n cuaternaria de nuestro pueblooriginario mapuche: la naturaleza, el ser humano, la lengua y lo divino.Mi obra en general parte de la escultura como una investigacií_npoí©tica, primero desde la anatomí_a con distintas maderasencajadas y ahora desde un tema antropolí_gico en fibrasvegetales y otros elementos de la naturaleza como materialidad.Esta materialidad me entregí_ el mensaje del íçrbol en todo suciclo y amplií_ mi mirada hacia la performance con sentido ritual,mis esculturas son livianas y adaptables al cuerpo, para serinterpretadas, idealmente en colectividad para potenciar mensajedesde distintas disciplinas.Mi trabajo se caracteriza por la creacií_n de esculturas de fibrasvegetales adaptables al cuerpo que representan seresmitolí_gicos que se repiten en las diferentes culturas de Amí©ricaprecolombina, reinterpretíçndolos como la conexií_n entre loselementos y la espiritualidad. Este trabajo le ha permitidoincursionar en la realizacií_n de ritos y acciones performíçticas, lasque le permiten dar curso a su inquietud por interpretar lasabidurí_a ancestral.Mi objetivo es generar conciencia de volver al rito, expresarmensaje en colectividad y sacar al arte de las galerí_as y susentido solo comercial.La motivacií_n es dar a conocer de manera creativa, la granriqueza de la sabidurí_a de nuestros pueblos originarios, fomentarel conocimiento de lo simple y mirar nuestras raí_ces, para crecercon identidad.ŒæMi obra emerge en la indescriptible ligereza de unlevantamiento natural, un brote, una eclosií_n desde lasombra hí_meda emerge arrastrando desde el inconsciente,los sonidos profundos de un Mantra, un Purrun Mapuche,como una estructura compleja que arbitra la fusií_n entreconceptos, arte indescifrable por el procedimiento de laspracticas puramente racionales.En Mí©xico trabajarí© con la obra MANDALA KITRAL, palabrasanscrita Mapuche que significa cí_rculo que en su interior,simbolizaríç el fuego con su movimiento telí_rico, conformadocon luces en su interior. El MANDALA funciona como unmapa de la realidad interior, que guí_a y apoya el desarrollo alcual estamos predispuestos a responder, la figura circular vacon la historia humana, y todo lo que hace el poder del mundolo hace el cí_rculo, siendo una ayuda visual y míçgica que noshace alcanzar ciertos estados mentales al entrar dentro delCirculo, y al actuar en í©l, creíçndolo, se convierte en un actosagrado y curativo, conectíçndonos con los ritmos cí_smicosdel Universo, expandiendo nuestra conciencia como sereshumanos, naturales y cí_smicos.ŒæUno de los principales objetivos artí_sticos en mi obra es rescatarelementos de nuestra historia y territorio sur, en un replanteamientoestí©tico y conceptual de í©stos. Incentivar al espectador a lacontemplacií_n y cuestionamiento acerca de su paisaje y el imaginariodel mundo precolombino mediante las artes visuales y multimediales.Por medio de la pintura recreo paisajes de volcanes del sur de Chile endiíçlogo con la flora y fauna local. Esto paisajes son complementadoscon versos en mapudungun y castellano escritos por el poeta huillichede la ciudad de la isla de Calbuco, Juan Paulo Huirimilla.Utilizo imíçgenes de video y fotografí_a captadas durante la erupcií_n delvolcíçn Calbuco, X regií_n, Chile, en abril 2015. Integro a la obra cantosen mapudungun (lengua del pueblo mapuche) mezclados con sonidospropios de la naturaleza (agua, viento, fuego, píçjaros).Materialidades de fibra natural, hojas de íçrboles, musgo y algas seponen en escena en un espacio que invita al espectador a desplazarseen una experiencia que exacerba los sentidos sumergií©ndonos en una atmí_sfera que transita desde lo visual, lo sonoro, lo tíçctil y olfativo.Desde hace 26 aí±os aproximadamente, los vidrios llegaron amí_ para convertirse en arte. De la tí©cnica del vitreaux al vidriofundido y a la combinacií_n del vidrio con otros materiales. Lanecesidad de incursionar en el color, las transparencias, lassuperposiciones, los juegos de luces me llevaron aexperimentar con la materia del vidrio como soporte.La bí_squeda de lo bidimensional a lo tridimensional, culminí_en la creacií_n de una serie de äóìvitroesculturasäó, que implicí_un acercamiento a nuestras raí_ces ancestrales, a sus mitosy leyendas. Mi trabajo se convirtií_ en un hacer, recoger, ycombinar piezas de vidrios cortados, pegados, fundidos,texturizados, en algunos casos con inclusií_n de pedazos decobre, fierro, alambres, vegetales y otros.Actualmente mi obra habla de espacios agrietados, abiertos,fisurados, convulsionados, obstruidos. Recortes de loterrenal, del universo, del infinito. Intensidades volcíçnicas,erupciones que arrasan lo viejo y crean lo nuevo desde lascenizas. Son pedacerí_as y fragmentos de nuestra moradacomí_n: la tierra y el universo. Es por lo tanto, una obrasiempre en proceso. Son series abiertas que pueden serintervenidas y continuadas.ŒæBusco indagar por medio de mis grabados, los cruces y lafragmentacií_n de la mirada que transforman la realidad, lugares que heindagado con recursos formales propios del grabado, la pintura, elcollage, letras, fragmentos de textos, fotografí_as tanto propias comorecuperadas de los medios gríçficos, retrato el paisaje neurí_tico de lasociedad actual desde una mirada rebelde, a lo que integra uncromatismo minimalista que evoca la estí©tica japonesa, la manchasobre la gríçfica como recurso expresivo configurando planossuperpuestos en los que alterna lo sensitivo sobre lo mecíçnico pormedio de la tí©cnica que míçs he desarrollado: la serigrafí_a.Las obras gríçficas se caracterizan por la yuxtaposicií_n de diferentesmatrices que van siendo impresas dentro del sentido de la repeticií_nque asemejan fragmentaciones de ciudades en ruinas, destruidas o deun territorio recorrido por la autora. El estilo de los grabados, pueden irdesde la abstraccií_n estí©tica a la figuracií_n, siempre interviniendo lasimíçgenes, trasladando de un a otro a modo un movimiento constante,Telí_rico metíçfora de un Territorio empí_rico a su propio territoriointerior.Mi trabajo es con tres elementos: acuarela, tinta china y polvo depiedra.Los trabajos en acuarela y tinta china son en gran formato yrepresentan el agrietamiento de la tierra, seríçn trabajados conpocos colores para realzar mayor dramatismo.El polvo de piedra, aplicado sobre una tela, es una tí©cnica quesugiere mucho la tierra, permite unos escurrimientos cuando seestíç realizando que sugiere la corrosií_n de esta.En un origen todo era una piedra volcíçnica, la arena misma ya estíçreducida a una desintegracií_n de la piedra. Las rocas con el tiempose van desmenuzando.En Chile se ha trabajado dos aspectos, la madera en el sur y en elnorte la piedra, material casi eterno.Es un producto natural de una tremenda resistencia y en el caso deChile existe por todo el paí_s por la cordillera y por la costa lo que leda una dignidad permanente.Del 7 AL 31 de OctubreŒæExhibicií_n de obra en el Museo ExConvento de TepoztlíçnTalleres: Ecograbado para nií±os por Antonella Rojas AudaTaller de Tejido en fibras por escultor Francisco RiosPresentacií_n de video ""IMAGINARIO PRECOLOMBINO"" de Verí_nica Astudillo.Charla ""El arte en vidrio en el siglo XXI"". por Cecilia Martner.Esta es una iniciativa independiente, que depende solamente de nuestros esfuerzos.ŒæNo contamos con patrocinio algunoŒæNo tenemos ningí_n a apoyo institucional.

368," What has fascinated me the most during my 17 years in the Berlin clubbing-scene, is the type of environment that is created in the various venues. Itäó»s not by accident that the last 13 of those years have been at what is now known as Berghain (formally OstGut). I find that when I try to describe what the äóÖBerghain experienceäó» is like, words like family, community and safe space come to mind. But they don't truly sufficeäó_Iäó»ve witnessed many forms of self-identification expressed by Berghainäó»s guests. From graphic interpretations of the building as prominently featured coverphotos on Facebook, to tattoos of the logo etched on the nape of necks. Rather than to attempt to describe the ever unique and therefore countless experiences one can have during a äóìKlubnachtäó, I chose instead to investigate the consistent relationship between myself and the buildingäó»s very structure. Iäó»ve focused on the spaces which felt like the warm, reassuring embrace of a friend, while in actuality being just a cold, concrete corner. It is in these spaces I could retreat into cognitive seclusion and see myself anew, time and time again.ŒæI am Rommelo Yu, an artist who has drawn inspiration from living endless days and nights in the heart of Techno. Hallenglas is a reflection (in the form of an installation) of my personal experience being part of the Berlin Club culture for over the past 17 years.Roughly 2 years ago, after creating Klubkronenleuchte, I found what became the inspiration to start working on Hallenglas.Two Japanese artists, Hokusai and Hiroshige created artistic homages to the same mountain, Mount Fuji, even creating their own ukiyo-e series similarly entitled ""Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji"". Erika Eiffel was the founder of OS Internationale; an organization for those who develop significant relationships with inanimate objects. To succeed in her Archery career, she drew inspiration from the Eiffel Tower. She later went on to mary the tower after having ended her 20-year relationship with the Berlin Wall.I like to describe these two examples as inspiration derived from resonance found between oneäó»s self and a structure. With Hallenglass, I took these ideas further.ŒæThe result: the use of modern technology to put on display and communicate the sensation provoked by the immersive experience that is Berghain.Stained glass windows. Each view is imbued with memories through the use of colors, but devoid of any other structures. Just me and the building äóñ one and the vibe.I need your help to make this a reality.Supporters of this project receive special gifts; namely, custom designed necklaces, entry to the exhibition, art prints, and even pieces of the artwork are all to be had, relative to the size of the contribution made.Download GIF to share with your friends!Want to know more about my work?

369," Face Value was conceptualised through research which analyzed the socio-cultural context of both historical self-portraits and selfies, in order to show evidence that these two forms of self-representation have similar cultural value. Investigations into the creation of identity in the age of social media, the social context of historical self-portraiture, and the effect of the popularisation of celebrity culture on cultural worth, led to the identification of common elements between the two forms of identity representation.ŒæIn order to give this equality of worth more exposure, Face Value aims to make the intangible currency of selfies tangible.ŒæFace Value plays on the social currency of digital identity by subverting the traditional process of minting coins. Previously, only those in royalty or immense power and fame had their portraits on coinage.  Now that anyone can create a globally recognised Self on the internet, the separation between 'general public' and those with fame and power is slight. By taking selfies from the public, passing them through a digital process, and casting the portraits onto individual and personalised 'coins' made from the metal from real currency, Face Value merges monetary and social currency into selfie-coinage.ŒæThis project will use a novel and innovative approach in its production by combining digital technologies of photography, social media, and computer-controlled machining with the traditional and physical processes of smelting, casting and minting.ŒæFace Value has been selected to appear in the 2018 Performance Arcade in Wellington on the 19th of February.Œæhttps://www.theperformancearcade.com/If funded, it will engage thousands of members of the public and encourage participation with the creation of a personalised token coin for each person.

371," William Ferdinand creates and uses art to express his emotion on canvas, having struggled with mental health issues, namely major depressive episodes spanning over a decade he regularly expresses himself with acrylic paint in abstract, contemporary & minimalist form. Often Pollock-esque, he however also finds his own style in times of great distress. For his upcoming project he has come to the conclusion that he would like to recreate current artworks and create new artworks in a more dramatic and bold statement using larger canvases and thus more paint. Then upon completion of the series 'Madness & Me' he desires to exhibit these works locally before attempting to gain momentum within certain circles to one day exhibit nationally and or internationally. His artwork is a visit into his mind, a discussion without works and a glimpse of true emotion captured in times of great struggle. Working in a supportive environment to help spur him on with his works he hopes to use this project to get through the winter and to represent the many whom suffer from mental health conditions that quietly suffer alone. Awareness is key with mental health and this project shall encapsulate dramatic works that will no doubt cause great discussion with regards to mental health."

We believe great art deserves to be seen, especially during times like these when devises leave little room for varying experiences. This piece will be a vast and thrilling experience to witness and we really hope you'll be a part of bringing it to life.Funds raised will go toward materials and labor in order to make this incredibly ambitious piece a reality. Please help us accomplish this vision that we feel will push art in an imperative direction.ŒæSky Diamond uses fluorescent tubes to occupy the space, allowing the viewer to experience the object as ""a line drawn with light in space.""Peters constructs twenty-three prisms stacked upon each other in order to make two equilateral triangels combining to create a diamond shape. The diamond pulsates with colored lumens challenging the structure of the surrounding room.This delicate-looking structure will float in the center of the room, allowing the viewers to experience light as three-dimensional drawing tool.The diamond shape alludes to the refraction of light achieved by the optical prism, which relies on perfection of angle and line in order to achieve differing wavelengths of light.

His work is represented in public and private collections worldwide.ŒæJason Peters is known for his site-specific large-scale installations, which examine the limits of human perception, sensory reaction and the biological effects of light. Stemming from a fascination with environment and spatiality, Peters attempts to evoke emotional and intellectual reactions to these objects. Within his practice, he utilizes patterns derived from mass-produced materials and unique found objects to construct sculptural pieces, which reflect upon or make reference to their surroundings. Peters has formed an interest in experimenting with light as a structural tool, exploring its ability to alternate from intensity to subtly, and our use o flight as utilitarian object.Œæwww.jasonpeters.comWe would be so grateful for you help. We believe Jason's work is incredible and deserves visibility and because of this we have dedicated ourselves to bringing his work to life. Please consider helping us!

374," Hello Everyone, and thanks for reading!ŒæLiterally all I want to do for the rest of my life is paint and plant trees. My goal is to create living installation artworks comprised of regionally native coniferous and deciduous trees, grasses, flowers, and a small amounts of food producing species in order to combat climate change, preserve and increase wild spaces, restore migration corridors, increase genetic diversity and resilience in both wild stock and food stock, while using using seed collected from my first small location in Two Harbors, Minnesota, from ditches, city sidewalks, storm drains, from trees downed by storms, from seed falling in-season, from my parent's gutters, and even from fruit I bought at my local co-op.The project is simple: for every $1 raised, either one tree seedling or four tree seeds will be directly planted to combat climate change.ŒæClimate change presents a range of challenges, varying projections, uncertainty, and dangers, and I want to dedicate the (hopefully) next 30+ years of my life to not only slowing the process of climate change but also mitigating the already significant effects in regards to wildlife and the stability of our food system. Among other challenges presented by climate change, we are seeing USDA plant hardiness zones moving by the year, which will have a profound impact, especially on trees; plants have their own specific tolerance ranges, and the climate is changing far more quickly than trees are able to spread through natural processes. We must give Nature a helping hand by planting trees and other plants at the edges of their tolerance ranges in anticipation of changing hardiness zones. I also believe we must plant food-producing tree species, especially those with more narrow tolerances and that are at-risk, inside of greenhouses in order to ensure their continued survival as well as our own. Additionally, wildlife species are starting to migrate into areas they previously had not existed, and we must support these species, who have just as much right to be here as we do, by ensuring migration corridors and safe passage.I don't have the time or the energy to convince the unconvinced, but have and will continue to share such information on social media, contact legislators, have personal discussions, and otherwise advocate action and education.ŒæAs a proof of concept, I purchased land in Two Harbors using personal funds and got to work. In the past 18 months, I have collected at least 500,000 tree seeds, of which I spread 350,000 in the field on the land I purchased. I also planted a token handful of seedlings that I had prepared previously. Another 100,000 I spread in trays, pots, and soil beds as test plots, and the last 50,000 I took special care and cold stratified (treated with freezing temperatures) in a variety of soil mixes to ensure some would be successful.ŒæI literally have no hope of counting the number of trees that came up. The tests surpassed my every expectation, with almost every method having some range of success, and germination rates of those that have had sufficient time to germinate and those I have been able to track and check have ranged from 15-90%, with a handful of strategies having near-perfect germination and 1-2 month survival. The first large scale planting last spring was comprised of two varieties of maple, approximately 60,000-70,000 seeds, had germination rates of about 18%, and nearly all were still alive last fall, though it is too early to determine winter survival. I also began collecting and spreading various wildflower and pollinator/insect friendly flowers and plants including yarrow, bergamot, sunflowers, lupine, and a token amount of a few others, but I do not yet have much data yet aside from a few seed trays (about 5,000 seeds total) of Lupine, which have sprouted but are tiny.My initial goal is $50,000, which would allow me to purchase and plant a second plot much further south, likely along the I-35 corridor as that is a popular migration route for migratory birds and insects.ŒæFor every $50,000 raised, I will be able to purchase another property to add to the diversity of ecosystems available for seed collection and propagation, and each will feature a work of art planted in wild species. Regardless of amount raised here or elsewhere, I will place a portion of land purchased and planted over the course of my life into irrevocable trusts to be set aside upon my death as natural spaces, to be managed by existing non-profits upon completion, and partially open to the public as free food forests, though I cannot foresee the exact timeline or amount of land that would qualify for that process and I am open to suggestions.I am currently determining the range of certifications required for Minnesota and some other states as well as various counties and localities in order to ensure legality, though I have verified legality of actions taken thus far, and am working towards Minnesota nursery certification and will start the process of organic farm/food production certification after either a nursery or arborist certification is completed.I purposely waited until after Earth Day to Launch this project publicly because I believe we need years or decades to repair the damage already caused, and I intend to spend my life both physically enacting this plan regardless of scale and advocating for Climate Change Action on every scale. Please note, I am not a non-profit, though I do not wish to be seen with a high profit motive. I will plant food species, sell plants, vegetables, and seek other revenue streams by which to remain sustainable after this fundraising push, including commissioned installation pieces (starting price is $100,000), though I will insist on creative control and reserve to right to refuse if the subject matter conflicts with the aims of this project. I don't need to be rich, but financially comfortable would be great, and most future proceeds from this project (and literally everything else I do for the next ~30 years or so, knock on wood,) will simply be reinvested to plant more installation pieces. I would like this project to become the largest set of installation artwork in the world, and by the time I die I hope it spans the world.The first painting I intend to enact as plantings is that of the map of Earth, with the oceans and waters being warm colors representing both grass and flower plantings as well as rising sea temperatures and levels, and the greens representing the land masses being tree seeds and seedlings yet to be sown. The map is artistic and not to scale, and I intend to select a more accurate representation on which to base my final painting; map experts and enthusiasts, please contact me to discuss the most optimal projection for this purpose.ŒæThe $1/seedling or $0.25/seed cost is the bare minimum that I would commit to planting, and funds would be divided at a ratio of 80% planted in seed and 20% planted in seedlings, with a +/- margin of error of 5%; in practice, the planting goals will likely be exceeded many times over. The fine print is that I have no idea how successful this will (or won't) be, so I am giving a time frame of a decade to plant up to 10,000,000, seeds and seedlings through this program, and though I don't expect it to reach anywhere near that much, 20 years if it exceeds that amount.While I have already started working with a few local organizations in Minneapolis and Two harbors to further this plan, I am open to working with any group, organization, non-profit, city, county, state, or federal agency, farmer, school district, or other entity, and more will be announced via the Seeds For Climate Change Facebook Page and soon-to-come website. I intended to be somewhat better prepared prior to launch, but my time is being spent with the trees and plants, rather than presentation and marketing. I'm more concerned about the outcome than I am appearances or polish, because methods and outcomes are the most important aspect of this project. I am using the following hashtags:#SeedsForClimateChange#Seeds4ClimateChangeThank you again for reading, and if you can't contribute financially, I am open to volunteer coordination and would be overjoyed if you shared this on social media and with your friends to help me gain traction.Œæ"

376," Thank you so much for your interest in ŒæShrouds of the Somme äóñ we are hugely grateful for your support.ŒæDespite an overwhelmingly positive response, we are not going to meet our crowdfunding target. It was an äóÖall or nothing campaignäó» which means no money will be taken from your account. ŒæAlthough we are very disappointed, Rob is continuing to stitch shrouds and one way or another, 72,396 shrouded figures will be laid out to remember those whose bodies were never recovered from the Somme battlefields. We are determined to see this through.ŒæThere have been some real success stories along the way including: gaining the wonderful British actor Jim Carter as patron; support from the Lord Lieutenant of London; a fabulous introduction from Show of Hands at their sold out Albert Hall concert; a hugely well-received launch at the Honourable Artillery Company and wide press coverage including BBC, ITV, Sunday Express and Soldier Magazine. There is more to comeäó_ŒæWe would like to ask two things of youäó_Œæ1.       Please consider honouring your pledge either by:Œæ- Œædonating to the Shrouds of the Somme HERE äóñ it will mean re-entering your details, but we hope that you will take the few minutes required to complete the process äóñ we can now also collect Gift Aid which will add at least 20% to your donationŒæŒæ- Œæpre-ordering one of the shrouds or photo books at our website HEREŒæ2.       Please send an email to info@shroudsofthesomme.com with the subject äóÖsubscribeäó» so that we can keep you up to date with progress as kickstarter does not share your contact details with us.ŒæThank you again for believing in this incredible project äóñ we will get there and honour those who gave their all.ŒæVery best wishesŒæRob, Jake, Mel and the Shrouds of the Somme teamHelpline: If you get stuck at any point feel free to call us onŒæ07940 950396 or email: friends@shroudsofthesomme.comTo mark 100 years since the end of the First World War, artist Rob Heard will stitch 72,396 shrouded figures to physically represent each of the British servicemen (+ 829 South African infantrymen) killed at the Battle of the Somme, whose bodies were never recovered from the battlefield.Planned for London in November 2018, the display is set to rival the Poppies at the Tower in impact and recognition of those who gave their lives. The Battle of the Somme was one of the bloodiest battles of the First World War, over a million men were killed or seriously wounded.  It is hard to comprehend the scale of this individual and collective sacrifice.ŒæRob's aim in creating this installation is to give a better understanding of the scale of the losses; what those vast numbers mean, and to individually honour each man who gave his life, but who to this day has no known grave. He wants in a small way to 'bring the boys home'.Jim Carter, star of Downton Abbey, recently became patron of the shrouds, and described the installation as äóìthe most moving and graphic depiction of the senseless death in the First World War that you can imagine.äó You can see him talking about it HEREEach body to a nameDuring the creation process Rob refers to a list of names of the British servicemen (and 829 South African infantrymen) whose bodies were never recovered and who are listed on the Thiepval Memorial in France, with data sourced from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.  Each figure he creates is associated with a name; each soldier individually acknowledged and remembered.Rob cuts and hand-stitches their calico shrouds, then covers and binds the figures in the shrouds in a ritual of creation, remembrance and personal introspection.  The figures have been specially made so that they are flexible enough to move into an individual shape as they are bound. Rob allows each one to take on their own form, twisting and bending into their own unique shape. The minimum we need to raise is Œ£150k.  This pays for basic materials, some money for Robäó»s time and some project costs.Once the project is funded and the exhibition takes place we will then be raising money for SSAFA the Armed Forces charity who have supported servicemen, veterans and their families in times of need for over 100 years.   At the exhibitions in Bristol and Exeter we raised over Œ£52,000 for SSAFA and Exeter Foundation.Your contribution is vital and this project cannot take place without you. Help make this vision a reality and be part of an extraordinary and internationally important piece of remembrance.ŒæThank you.Œæ"
377," ŒæMISSION STATEMENT- PROJECT SUMMARY ŒæThe installation seeks to promote Empathy by teaching people how to understand what others are feeling without bias or confusion. We want to help shape a world where people can appreciate each otheräó»s differences while celebrating the similarities that make us all Human.ŒæHOW IT WORKS ŒæOur philosophy is: ""Shared pain is lessened and shared joy is increased,"" -Spider Robinson. We feel that you can achieve a greater understanding of yourself and respect for your neighbor through shared experience and analysis.ŒæWe ask participants to examine their relationship with strangers through a series of eight social experiments. The last experiment provides them with the ability to watch others in that same situation for comparison through the use of CCTV.ŒæAlthough the stations can be visited in any order, participants completing them in sequence will experience a gradual increase in social interaction and bonding.INSTALLATION OVERVIEWThe main feature of this installation is a 40äó»x40äó» octagonal tent encompassed on seven sides by individual 15äó»x11äó» pop-up tents. Each of the 8 stations is a live social experiment designed to reinforce the similarities shared between individuals and society as a whole. Each of the social experiments focuses on the everyday interactions, customs, and rituals that we sometimes take for granted. Like, why do so many people talk about the weather in an elevator?ŒæGOAL -Œæto answer the question: äóìCan you create empathy by increasing one personäó»s ability to recognize and share the emotions of another?äóIMPORTANCE ŒæThere is an inherent and growing, äóìUS vs. THEMäó mentality (in the world) that is not only harmful for personal development it is dangerous for the development of society as a whole. Knowing what someone else is feeling plays a fundamental role in our daily interactions, but we often work from very bias information. The assumption being that, äóìMy strong emotional response to this situation stems from the same experience as your strong emotional response.äó This however is rarely the case.ŒæŒæ INTERACTIVITYŒæPassport Books - At Station 1, äóìThe Hawthorne Effectäó Visitors will receive an individually numbered, äóìPassportäó book containing 80 blank pages and an insert outlining important information regarding each of the stations including: The locations of all experiments on a sitemap; experiment details and experience; approximate completion time; (as well as) the relationship of each experiment to the Burning Man 2017 theme of äóìRituals.äó ŒæAfter participants complete an experiment they collect a stamp in their Passport Book from the corresponding ""Goal Pole"" (stamping stations) and make a few notes about their experience on the following pages. ŒæŒæAt Station 7, any participant who completes all of the social experiments will have the opportunity to get their picture taken and be apart of our live mosaic photo wallŒæshowing an aerial view of the installation made of tiny photos of every other visitor who completed all 8 of the social experiments or donated $100 to our Kickstarter fund.After the event we will make the photo available for download for people on our website and aŒæprofessionally printed and framed image will also be mailed to individuals who donated more than $150 to the Stations of Humanity Kickstarter fund.Œæ"
378," Hello and thank you for coming to our Kickstarter page! As the video showed we are going to create a communal space in which artists and the community can come together to share in a beautiful space that they create collaboratively. Our hopes is to have this event to grow and become either a bi-monthly (twice a month) or monthly event. We are asking for fundraising so we can both cover our costs and hopefully raise enough funds to make this into a bigger and better event. Our hopes and dreams are to pay partners for their works and time, to grow and build the space to include more collaborations, to give back to the community through donations and onsite programs, and to just generally improve the level of professionalism we are able to manifest. We would love for this to become something that the whole community can enjoy in, from families, to artists, to neighbors, pretty much anyone, and the limits are only as far as our imaginations and funding will allow. As of now we are covering the costs of the first event, but the sustainability of the event is going to rely on fundraising and donations at the time of the event, that's where you come in.Anything you can contribute would be much appreciated, we will have ongoing coverage of the event through our instagram page and facebook pages promoting both artists and the event as well as wrap up videos to show what your funding created. You can follow us on instagram at livingroombungalow and on facebook atŒæhttps://www.facebook.com/livingroombungalow/We thank you for your support and appreciate everything you have to offer.

379," Sweetgrass and Sage Burn is a donation-based transformational festival of workshops, art, and music. We are focused on addressing and truly facing the way modern society functions at its root, and sharing ways we can ground and educate ourselves as a human family to live more mindfully, healthily, and symbiotically with life.ŒæThis is a project being organized by the grassroots collective, The Grand Rapids Autonomous Support System.Last year we traveled to various festivals around the region creating safe spaces, performing music and poetry, and offering workshops. While we were traveling we met a lot of diverse humans and organizations and got a taste of how many sincere hearts around the nation are dedicating themselves to creating change in our society. So, around a camp fire, we decided we wanted to create a common ground where people can share knowledge on things like community organizing, wellness, and the many challeges affecting our society, and compliment this with a celebration of art, music, and the connections we forge as community.ŒæEveryone from the artists, to production, to performers are offering their energy to make this gathering all it can. We are asking a donation of $42 to help us cover our costs but we don't want money to be a barrier between anyone and this space we are craft, so if you can't meet the minimum donation, please, please, please reach out to us so we can craft some kind of exchange!We can be reached at SGSBFestival@gmail.com"
380," I am Sean Barber, a Detroit Ceramic mixed media artist, currently working on a large scale Ocean Installation for Artprize 2017... I hope you will support me in making my dream a reality. I am offering personal rewards including hand made ceramic shells, beach sand and photographs of the Detroit Art Scene.By the way,ŒæI am a Pisces, a water sign very much connected to this Ocean Front Installation.As a child growing up in Michigan during the 70's, I spent most of my time playing in the woods or at the beach. I love creating unique pieces by combining wood with ceramics. My childhood was driven by exploring the wonders of nature. My artwork is a reflection of those memories.The past 5 years have been life changing for me, my late return to Art school after 20 years and the rebirth of Detroit have created a new life for me in a world of possibilities.I am very active in the  Detroit Art Scene and have been working as a professional artist since 2009.ŒæThe birth of this installation comes from life, memory and the passing of my Grandparents at a place so familiar I like to call it home (The Ocean). My Grandpa was a preacher and a scuba diving teacher, and my Grandma always gave it to me straight. They spent much of their retirement living between Florida and the Grand Cayman Islands. This installation is a symbol of my admiration for their souls, and the memories which remain.ŒæThis project is also about me and my life as a struggling artist trying to make an identity in a big beautiful world by creating through experience and memory.

385," Art is a powerful tool of expression and it is a reminder to what once was. Posters always send a powerful message that cannot be unspoken. While fascism is rapidly growing, a positive way to respond to this trend is by posting large pieces of classic posters across the city as reminder and as an art installation.We will use any means necessary to print as many large classic posters as possible and have them seen by the city. We will also create our own original messages too such as educational posters teaching what fascism is. It will be a clear reminder for those who are for democracy, for art, and for anyone who loves expression that together we stand strong and that together we will send a clear message against hate. Art is about beauty and sending a clear message. Our message through this project is that fascism, no matter what it is called will not be tolerated and there will be resistance. We have a duty to respond in kind with peaceful means of expression.ŒæCurrently the greatest cost is printing. For 50 posters of ""24 x 26"" it will cost an estimated $1500. However we may use different and cheaper means if it means more than 50 posters can be printed and we will print in various sizes to overcome cost per poster. The only barrier right now is the cost to print. The average cost per medium sized poster is $35. The larger the poster, the more it costs.

ŒæŒæDas Bundesland Prijedor befindet sich im Nordwesten von Bosnien und Herzegowina, auf dem Ufer der Flí_sse Sana und Gomjenica. Nach den Ergebnissen der Volkszí_hlung von 1992 hatte die Gemeinde 112 543 Einwohner, davon waren 43,9% Bosniaken, 42,3% Serben, 5,7% Jugoslawen, 5,6% Kroaten und 2,5 % andere.Damit will ich deutlich machen, dass im Jahr 1992 anhand der offiziellen Definition in der Gemeinde Prijedor wí_hrend des Krieges Ví_lkermord begangen wurde. Fí_r jeden Punkt der Genozid-Definierung nehme ich je eine Aussage der Zeugen, die vor dem Internationalen Strafgerichtshof in Den Haag (NL) ausgesagt haben. Dies untermauert meine Stellungnahme und beweist das bewusst begangene Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit in Prijedor 1992.

Sogar den 102 unschuldig getí_teten Kindern wird bis auf weiteres, seitens der Gemeinde Prijedor, ein Denkmal unterschlagen.Meine luftgeformte halbkugelfí_rmige Installation aus weiíôem Textil hat einen Radius von 3 Metern. Sie ist í_ber zwei einander gegení_berliegende schmale Eingangsí_ffnungen betretbar. Zweck dieser Anlage ist die Vermittlung des Angstgefí_hls bei geschlossenen Rí_umen und des Gefí_hls der Unfí_higkeit, entfliehen zu kí_nnen, also zu spí_ren, wie es ist, gefangen und eingesperrt zu sein. Dies ist nur ein Bruchteil von Gefí_hlen, die Gefangene der Konzentrationslager erleben mussten. Das Denkmal ist in weiíôer Farbe und fast durchsichtig, um den Effekt zu erzeugen, Silhouetten von innen zu erkennen, jedoch nicht zu wissen, wie die Umgebung einen wahrnimmt, und dass man in Wahrheit in der Falle steckt.  In der Installation ist mann gezwungen den Opfern ins Gesicht zu sehen und die Zeugenaussagen zu hí_ren.ŒæMein Projekt steht fí_r alle zivilen Kriegsopfer von Prijedor. Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Es reprí_sentiert den ersten Baustein fí_r ein dauerhaftes Denkmal in dieser Gemeinde. ŒæDieses so wichtige Projekt soll als Installation durch Europa reisen. Die Reise beginnt in Sarajevo am 30. April 2017, genau 25 Jahre nach dem Beginn des Krieges in Prijedor.ŒæDarauf folgen die Stationen Wien, Brí_ssel, Berlin, Stockholm, Zagreb, Belgrad, Prijedor und Den Haag, wo es vor dem Internationalen Strafgerichtshof aufgestellt wird. Die genannten Stí_dte sind nur einige von vielen, wo das Kunstwerk platziert und prí_sentiert werden wird.In der gesamten Zeit des Projekt wird ein Filmteam das Projekt begleiten um ein Dokumentar Film darí_ber zu drehen. Wie bei den Ní_harbeiten.Œæhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9k1NUlwZdGu-u8Spc6IJALC1a4qhB0oUPrijedor | Wichtige Fakten í_ber Entstehung und Umsetzung des Genozids 1992 :  ŒæPrijedor ist eine Stadt im Nordwesten von Bosnien und Herzegowina  an den Ufern der Flí_sse Sana und Gomjenica. Nach der Volkszí_hlung von 1992 hatte die Stadt 112 543 Einwohner, davon 43,9% Bosniaken, 42,3% Serben, 5,7% Jugoslawen, 5,6% Kroaten und 2,5 % andere.  09.Januar 1992  Die Republika Srpska (RS) wird an diesem Tag, also noch vor dem Krieg, gegrí_ndet.  (1995 wird der bosnische Landesteil, in dem wí_hrend des Kriegs Nichtserben systematisch vertrieben oder ermordet wurden, im Friedensabkommen von Dayton anerkannt.)Œæ 21.Mí_rz 1992 Die Serbisch Demokratische Partei SDS ergreift im ganzen Land die Kontrolle í_ber die Medien fí_r Propagandazwecke. Die Satellitenempfí_nger werden manipuliert. Es kommen nur noch Nachrichten aus Belgrad durch.   30. April 1992 Die offiziell gewí_hlte Regierung der Stadt Prijedor wird í_ber Nacht von der SDS gestí_rzt.Œæ  22.Mai 1992 Serbische Streitkrí_fte greifen das Dorf Hambarine an, zwei Tage spí_ter wird auch Kozarac angegriffen.   31.05.1992 Die Behí_rden der bosnischen Serben in Prijedor erlassen per Radio ein Dekret, in dem es heiíôt, dass alle Nichtserben (Bosniaken, bosnische Kroaten etc.) ein weiíôes Tuch an ihr Fenster hí_ngen und beim Verlassen ihres Hauses ein weiíôes Armband tragen sollten. Vorbild ist offenkundig die Brandmarkung von Juden und anderen ethnischen, religií_sen oder sozialen Gruppen durch das Naziregime im Jahr 1939.  Mit diesem Aufruf fí_llt die Entscheidung zur ethnischen Sí_uberung von Prijedor mit der Umsetzung folgender Fakten:ŒæIn den aufgezí_hlten Lagern werden aber auch bosnische Serben gefangen, weil sie ihren Nachbarn, Freunden und Familienangehí_rigen geholfen oder einfach ein anderes Glaubensbekenntnis hatten.  Tausende von Menschen werden gefoltert, vergewaltigt, deportiert oder ermordet. Weder das Geschlecht noch das Alter spielen bei diesen grauenvollen Taten eine Rolle. In Prijedor werden 3.173 Zivilisten ermordet, davon 256 Frauen und 102 Kinder. In weniger als 3 Monaten werden 94% der nicht serbischen Beví_lkerung liquidiert oder vertrieben.   Den Opfern des Genozids in Prijedor wird bis heute von den lokalen Behí_rden jede Aufmerksamkeit fí_r ihr Leid verweigert. Der Bí_rgermeister Marko Pavic und die Behí_rden lehnen es ab, die in Prijedor begangenen Verbrechen í_ffentlich anzuerkennen.  Gedenktage wie der 31.Mai 1992 sind auíôerordentlich wichtig, da Prijedor und der gesamte Balkan die Geschehnisse auch nach 23 Jahren nicht verarbeitet haben.  Kriegsverbrechen, Massenmord, Konzentrationslager und Massengrí_ber mí_ssen anerkannt und verurteilt werden und wichtige Plí_tze verdeutlicht werden. Das ist ein wichtiger Schritt, um nachhaltig Frieden schlieíôen und gemeinsam weiterleben zu kí_nnen.ŒæHeute ist Prijedor auf einer Seite ein Beispiel von Rí_ckkehr, Wiederaufbau und das gemeinsame Leben in Frieden. Jedoch ist dieses sogenannte friedliche Miteinander Leben nur oberflí_chlich, weil man í_ber die Ereignisse der Vergangenheit nicht sprechen darf. Oft wird den íìberlebenden der Zutritt zu den ehemaligen Konzentrationslagern verweigert, die bis dato nicht als Konzentrationslager gekennzeichnet sind. Die Regierung von Prijedor ignoriert die Schreiben der zahlreichen Vereine, Denkmí_ler an die gefallenen Opfer zu errichten oder andere Aktivití_ten zum Gedenken zu setzen.ŒæOpis projekta ŒæTema mog diplomskog rada je äó_Prijedor 92-prikriveni genocidäóì.ŒæOvim zelim jasno pokazat, da je po zvanicnoj definiciji 1992 u toku agresije na Bosnu i Hercegovinu u Opcini Prijedoru pocinjen genocid. Za svaku tacku definicije pojma Genocid, uzet cu po jednu izjavu svjedoka koji su svoje iskaze dali pred medjunarodnim  sudom pravde u Den Haag-u. Na taj nacin podupirem svoju tezu i dokazujem da je u Prijedoru 1992 pocinjen zlocin protiv covjecnosti. Osvrcuci se na Tomasicu, kao najvecu masovnu grobnicu poslije Drugog svjetskog rata, umjetnicki dio mog projekta cu biti instalacija spomenika. Kao sto sam vec spomenula, nesrpskom stanovnistu nije dozvoljeno da postavi bilo kakvu vrstu spomenika niti da objesi plakete na mjesta bivsih koncentracionih logora (Keraterm, Trnopolje, Omarska). Cak ni  102 neduzno ubijenoj djeci do danas od strane vlasti u Prijedoru nije dozvoljeno podizanje  spomenobiljezja. ŒæMoja zrakom formirana, polukruzna instalacija ima radijus od 3m.ŒæU njenu unutrasnjost se moze uc kroz dva oprecno postavljena ulaza. Svrha ove postavke je simulacija panike od zatvorenog prostora i osjecaja nemoci za bjegstvo, osjecaja kako je to biti uhvacen i zatvoren. Ovo je samo mali dio osjecanja koja su zatvorenici logora prolazili. Spomenik je bijele boje i skoro providan. Cilj je bio da se mogu nazirat siluete a efekat toga je da vidimo iznutra da se nesto desava vani, ali da ne znamo jasno kako nas okolina dozivljava i da smo zapravo zatoceni.  Unutar instalacije dolazi do suocavanja sa licima zrtava i paralelno ce se slusat njihove izjave u pozadini. ŒæMoj projekat posvecujem svim civilnim zrtvama rata u Prijedoru. On predstavlja kamen temeljac prvom stalnom spomeniku u Opcini Prijedor. Ovaj bitni rad treba kao instalacija da putuje Evropom.ŒæPutovanje ce poceti 30.04.2017 u Sarajevu, tacno na 25.godisnjicu pocetka rata u Prijedru. Potom slijede Bec, Brisel, Berlin, Stokholm, Zagreb, Beograd, Prijedor i Den Haag, gdje ce bit postavljen pred medjunarodnim sudom pravde. Spomenuti gradovi su samo neki od mnogih, u kojima ce instalacija biti pokazana.ŒæCijelokupni dogadjaj ce sve vrijeme pratit snimateljska ekipa, koja ce poslije napravit dokumentarac o tome, kao I za vrijeme izrade spomenika. "

389," The ADAM wants to welcomeŒæJA, a performative installation inspired byäóÂJosef Albers,the concept of abstractness and unicorns by OHT. The show will be presented at ADAM,Œæjust 150 m from the Atomium, the symbol of Brussels.Born only one year ago, the ADAM is a museum dedicated to art and design of theXX and XXI century.ŒæNow, you can become a contributor for OHT's latest sitespecific installation äóñ performance for the first time in Belgium. Your helpwill allow them to do the rehearsals and a period of set-up before thepresentation on the 14thŒæ and15th of May.JA is a site-specific version of Squares do not (normally) appear in nature, a show by OHT that buildson how Josef Albers himself drew away when he left the Bauhaus for America. Hewas not only traveling across the Atlantic to a new life in the US, but also toa deeper kind of observation -one that brought him to the essence of how theworld and objects are built and thus perceived.By presenting the exhibition The Bauhaus #itsalldesign, the ADAMŒæis the ideal context to show OHTäó»s performanceinspired by Josef Albers, who played a leading role in transmitting the moderndesign principles of the Bauhaus to the United States and whose fundamentalresearches are displayed in the exhibition.ŒæJA confronts the audience with an aural and visualspace: 13 experiments of sound and vision without the use of performers. Theworkäó»s basis is the awareness of colours via certain protagonists: light, mist,glass, font and image. This is akin to how apparently abstract themes are theactors of Josef Albersäó»s research of reality.Observation is connected to the physical action ofseeing. Albersäó»s words and criteria, as much as his materials äóñ his palette andhis objects äóñ visually connect the audience to a renewed kind of narration. Aslowed down narration, which brings the audience to terms with unfamiliarreferences and their own predisposition to open eyes. An attitude that Albershas already envisaged with his work. Perception, as Albers conceived it in histeaching, from the years of Bauhaus to Black Mountain College and Yale, is nowon stage. JA is -first of all- an invitation to hear, see andspend time. This work also regards nature and what normally doesnäó»t appear init. In particular, the performance dramatizes abstract effects by stagingnatural phenomena such as rainbows and the northern lights. This specificchoice deconstructs the misleading convention that abstract art is tooimpersonal or cold. No wonder that Elaine de Kooning noted äóìhowever impersonalhis paintings might at first appear, not one of them could have been painted byany one but Josef Albers himselfäó.The Bauhaus#itsalldesign,is an exhibition by Vitra Design Museum and it will be hosted by ADAMŒæŒæthis year from March, 15 to June, 11. The exhibition presentsa comprehensive overview of design at the Bauhaus encompassing a multiplicityof rare, in some cases never seen before, exhibits from the fields of design,architecture, art, film and photography. At the same time, it confronts theBauhaus design with current debates and tendencies in design and with the worksof contemporary designers, artists and architects. In this way, The Bauhaus #itsalldesign reveals the surprising present-day relevance of alegendary cultural institution.WHAT IS OHT?The artistic research of OHT takes on from the wishthat Google does not answer to all the questions. Therefore, OHT investigatesreality and its representation without limits in terms of shape, genre andemotion. OHT has collaborated with national and international institutions suchas Artistsäó» Salon NYC äóñ ONDA (FR), Triennale di Milano (IT), Prague Quadriennal(CZ), Whitechapel Gallery London (UK), MAXXI museum (IT) and many more.

393," Folks, I am COMPELLED to make this happen in memory of John B. McLemore. I am making a promise to you and to all who share a desire to pay tribute to one of humanity's brilliant minds, that I will do everything I can to make this happen!If you're reading this message, chances are you too were captivated by the incredible story of a man challenged by his own brilliance and misunderstood by so many. You and I have probably shared similar emotions as we listened in awe during Brian Reed's masterful narration of John's life during the 7-part Podcast: S-Town. If so, I hope you will embark on this journey with me.I made the conscious decision not to look up any web images of John's masterful maze in effort to allow my imagination to paint a picture of what I believed the hedge maze would look like on my own. Immediately following the 7th episode, I began exploring images of the maze and was blown away by the intricacy and craft John dedicated to making his vision become a reality.ŒæHonestly, this effort is strictly a concept at this point but my ultimate goal is to make a complete replica of the John B. McLemore maze for all to admire and experience. My vision is to incorporate as many aspects of the maze into this replication, even if it requires flying Tyler Goodson up to Indianapolis and paying for his time to make this recreation as authentic as possible. I would also welcome any feedback/assistance Mr. Reed could provide to ensure this effort is an honest tribute.ŒæAny funds donated to this effort will be shared publicly utilizing an ""open-book"" methodology to ensure that none of this project is self-serving. Any additional proceeds netted from the effort will be donated to non-profit organizations dedicated to shedding light on the Mad Hatter disease as well as any additional foundations that would parallel John's vision for a more sustainable world. I would intend to work with those who knew John best to identify such foundations.Again, this is strictly a vision at this point but I'm hopeful we can capture the interest of our fellow supporters to make this dream become a reality!Thank you for your shared interest!"
394," Roccapalumba (Sicily, Italy) is called ""The Stars' Country"" thanks to its two Astronomical Observatories and a Planetarium, the idea is to increase interest in astronomy with a creation of an astronomical village that will improve the existing structures in one hand, and will crate a turistic attractive in another hand. The astronomical village will contain astronomical clocks, sundials, telescopes that will be instructive and artistic at the same time, and also it will contain a park with astronomical toys for children to increase their love for stars and universe. Into the astronomical village there will be also a science exihibit where maths and physics become a play for children and adults, to approach to the knowledge of Platone, Archimede, Pitagora and their discoveries."
395," Here goes!This project is for my final degree show in June, which will then end my time at university! The reason I'm using Kickstarter is to raise funds for my final piece as I'm hoping to go out with a bang, but I won't be able to achieve my goal without some help!I plan to make 1-3 giant teddy bears to act as interactive art, along side a CRT Monitor playing a film that I've made, on loop. The plush teddy bears will be larger than the average person (over 6ft tall) and anyone will be able to hug, kick, jump and relax on them over the entire run of the exhibition.To create these giant teddy bears I will need a lot of cardboard/paper, fabric, stuffing, thread, weights and patience; 5 out of 6 of those will require money! Which is hopefully, where you guys come in...My practice this past year has been based around the question ""Is it morally right to use animals for our own gain?"". This could mean anything, from guide dogs to help the disabled, to elephant riding for our entertainment. I have volunteered with police and domesticated dogs in England to see the differences in how they are treated. I was also lucky enough to get a bursary and extend my research further by going to Thailand. I volunteered with the mistreated dogs over there, which really changed the path I was on with my project. I was also lucky enough to spend a week with elephants, which informed my practice even further, helping me to gain research that I wouldn't have been able to attain had I only stayed in England.After many months of research, the main thing that kept cropping up - time and time again - was how animals are used for human profit. To demonstrate this, for my final piece I am creating teddy bears to reflect how children use toys for their own entertainment and pleasure, before dismissing them when they are no longer of use. Whilst observing our societal relationships with animals, it was brought to light just how entitled we think we are as a species to use animals all around the world for our own gain.My hope for this piece is to create an elephant, sheep and dog teddy bear - all filled with feathers, wool and generic stuffing. This is to represent another way we use animals, even if we can't see it. Once I finish making these teddies I will 'hurt' them in all the places I saw the animals hurt on my volunteering courses. The degree show will run from 12th - 23rd June 2017 in the SIA Gallery, Sheffield, UK.ŒæLast but not least, if for whatever reason I have leftover money from these donations, I won't be profiting! Instead, I will split the money between 3 animal charities that I have linked below:http://www.seashepherd.orghttps://www.animalaid.org.ukhttp://www.animalhopeandwellness.org "

With an Art Fair of artists and groups from all over the world, it is our honour to be part of it and share our work with everyone.From small home collection to a multi-media collage projectBREAKFAST TABLE was a small collection in my laptop start from 2014, to collect the news in digital form, like videos of democratic movements, FB news feed discussion of elections, TV news sound bites of refugees... all kind of mass media stimulating you in every morning.After arranged and edited, it comes up to an experimental collage installation. To share the view of living, political, humanity or just the opinion of the NEWS.How the fund be used?BREAKFAST TABLE is a non-profit art project. We are spending own money and own time to make it happen. The fund we seek this time will be using in the project first released in Taipei Free Art Fair : Travel costs from Hong Kong to Taipei, accommodation costs, costs for all print out materials, costs for the props and decorations.The inner issue we would like to discuss in the collage-- Daily -- We read news and crisis happen in everywhere thanks for the mass media feeding us every day . The crisis happened far away from us locationally, but as a human being, can it touching you? Sometimes I saw theyäó»re having the same food like mine in the news. Is it sort of linkage ? Sort of connection?-- Iäó»m not you, I can never be the same like you. True?-- Iäó»m not the refugee, am I really canäó»t understand how they feel? I was in a protest, is it mean that I understand all the protest? Can we help? Can we give an opinion? What do we need to work on and improve the world? Can we really help and change the world? Can we change something ? Are we really helping? Or we should do nothing?No one can tell easily, we try to look for an answer through the creative process.BREAKFAST TABLE is not a one-time installation exhibition, we would like to bring the table everywhere for share.We got two set of collages editing meanwhile, will be ready to show at the Art Fair in 2016 Nov. More collage pieces will continue to appear in next year. We really hope you will support us by sending us love !Financially support is very important for us to bring the work travel overseas!

Think of buildings, transport and people suddenly being eaten by fungi...Right, okay, creepy but just think of what it would look like, pretty damn cool I would say!So my endeavour for my final year is to construct a small scale fungal architectural paradise, my vision for this art piece is that it will be encompassing. my intention for the viewer is that they will be completely immersed in the work.The money I raise will go towards fresh produce that will serve as a catalyst for fungi growth, acrylic;which will be the architectural structure for the fungi to grow on. Sounds clips to install in to the space to further immerse the public.I thank you so much for getting this far, I love what I do and I want to share my quirky love for fungi with others. A healthy dose of appreciation for life that exists without us can do wonders...The display of the work will be on show in the University of Kent Degree Show during April/May. Date to be confirmed."
399," Intercultural, Art For World Peace will exhibit at Etra Fine Art Gallery in the heart of Wynwood Arts District in Miami during Art Basel, Dec. 1-4, 2016. The Fine Art Photography collection Intercultural raises awareness to the many nationalities living in modern day society by enlightening ideologies while initiating a common respect to all humanity and ultimately a peaceful coexistence. I have secured Etra Fine Art Gallery in the heart of Wynwood Arts District. During this period galleries charge Artist an upfront fee to showcase their art as funding is needed for art production, shipping and promotion. Miami Art Basel is the most important Contemporary Art Fair that happens in America as 29 countries send their most powerful, curators, collectors, gallery owner and artists.I need your support to help unite humanity through art!Thank you,Sheinina Raj"
400," ArtEast Map will be a free printed art map and web page indicating the key galleries, artist studios and other creative places that are located in the East End of London; with the vision of building opportunities for many more people to reach and enjoy the art in this rapidly changing part of the city.After introducing the project to galleries in areas of Hackney and Tower Hamlets, the project have support from galleries such as Flowers, IMT Gallery, Degree Art, Bow Arts, Print Club London, Nelly Duff, Hang up Gallery, Arebyte, Peer Gallery, Calvert 22 and many others.There will be no distinction made between galleries as the idea is to provide locals and visitors with an almost exhaustive listing in the selected area.The ArtEast Map will be printed to a high-quality standard and designed by the East London based illustrator and printmaker Claudia Borfiga. It will be completed by an ergonomic web page constantly updated with galleries' new exhibitions and events.It will also highlight a selection of cafes, bars and restaurants close by where artists hang out and where gallery visitors might like to take a break.The printed map will obtain information relevant to the selected participants as well a calendar of events for the upcoming year 2017.ŒæŒæHow was the idea born?We have noticed that many East London art spaces are too often under-represented on art listings, art mobile apps and tourist guides, even though they are areas of London with some of the most substantial cultural and creative activity. Hackney Wick and Fish Island together has recently been recognised the biggest concentration of artists and art activities in Europe.Unit G Galleryäó»s primary mission is to help sustain our local artists and we desire to increase the number of visitors participating in art activities in East London and to offer them useful up-to-date information. We will engage with creative locals to facilitate connections with them.Too often, London tourists are orientated to major gallery names when looking for creative and cultural experiences, when some of them are more eager to discover hidden gems and to connect with the soul of the area they are exploring. We want them to know that there are alternative activities they can do which wonäó»t necessary be the better-known City of London Art Tours.Who is ArtEast map for?ArtEast Map will feature such a wide range of artworks that it is made for anyone and any taste. A short description of each space will be provided to make sure the chosen places will best fit the moment and the mood.We would aim to distribute the map to prospective East London art lovers, be they local residents or tourists, and ask that the galleries and art spaces represented on it will maintain printed copy stocks.We intend for the map to be made available in cafes, bars and restaurants in the area as well as neighbouring businesses and tourist centres.ŒæWhat are the concerned areas?Tower Hamlets : Victoria Park, Fish Island, Bow, Mile End, Stepney Green, Columbia Road, Bethnal Green, Brick Lane and Spitafields.Hackney : Hackney Downs, Lower Clapton, Hackney Wick, Hackney Central, London Fields, Homerton, Dalston, Haggerston and HoxtonŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæAfter introducing the project to galleries in areas of Hackney and Tower Hamlets, the project have support from galleries such as Flowers, IMT Gallery, Degree Art, Bow Arts, Print Club London, Nelly Duff, Hang up Gallery, Arebyte, Peer Gallery, Calvert 22 and many others.Local networking to reach a global audience. With all galleries and participants each communicating their news, every gallery will be able to benefit from each otheräó»s network to be sure they touch a greaterrange of art aficionados. ArtEast Map will also have a presence on social media. Participants will be mentioned in these posts to create synergies and target the right audiences.The ArtEast Map must aim to increase awareness of, and hence traffic to, both virtual and physical creative spaces.The rise of community-based initiatives and local businesses shows how popular demand can push against the dominance of global brands, especially in an area like East London with its own strong identity. Yet when all local players act together there is a better chance if reaching a global audience.How will the money be spentWe are asking for Œ£10,000 that will be distributed as follow:Œ£2000 for the illustration and design of the mapŒ£1500 to print 5000 copies of the mapŒ£1500 to reward the people who have helped us realising the campaign (Video maker, staff)Œ£2000 to develop an interactive mobile friendly web pageŒ£3000 for promotion and to fund the launch event"
401," ""Hey guys, looks like the museum failed."" What? No, absolutely not! The museum is still alive and well. It's an idea that won't go away, that occupies our consant thoughts. At worst I would say that this Kickstarter campaign failed. Why? Two reasons.First, our goal was pretty high. We knew that going in. But if we only aimed for and got $8500 in rewards, we would not have been able to do very much with it. You would have been sorely disappointed with what that annual pass got you.Second, our campaign didn't spread as far as it should have. We traced metrics through Facebook, Twitter and other online social media. You guys did a decent job of helping us spread the word. But we really missed the mark on the local media. We tried, it just didn't stick. And many of the larger LEGO fan blogs didn't pick us up. Maybe they figured we were too local to interest their worldwide fan bases. Or maybe they didn't like our head shots.""So the museum is still happening then?"" Oh, definitely. Maybe not as huge as we had envisioned, but we'll enjoy our holidays then rework our vision, find additional funding sources beyond what we currently have, and present a new opportunity for you to help. Maybe it will be on Kickstarter, maybe not.This was a great learning opportunity though. We gained so much knowledge through the metrics about what you wanted, where you came from and how willing many people were to help make it happen.So enjoy your holidays and keep an eye out for what's coming next. You can check in here or join the conversation via our communication list atŒæhttp://www.brixmuseum.com/.ŒæWe'd love to have you continue to join us on our journey!-----I love collecting. And building. And sharing with others. And... warehouses? I've always been attracted to large open indoor spaces where creativity and inspiration can abound without threat of rain, vandals, or pigeons. After running my own Bricklink (secondary market LEGOŒ¬ parts) store for several years I decided I wanted to go bigger. I'd been picking up odd parts as extras in orders, from thrift stores, and from free bins. While they were fun to look at I thought it would be nice to share them with others. Anyone can go look at the Bricklink catalog and see every part ever made. But to see it all under one roof? Now that would be awesome!If you wanted to see a LEGO Museum, where would you go? Billund, Denmark, home of LEGO? Or you could visit the Czech Republic. Still too far away? Maybe Ohio is more suitable. But west of the Mississippi? Nothing.Hence, BRIX. Build, Rebuild, Inspire and Experience.Of course a museum should be about more than just walking through a stuffy space to see things. It should be engaging, hands on, an experience! Have you ever heard of Znap? Do you know how it works with the rest of the LEGO system? Do you want to play with some? Why not!Or maybe you'd like to come to a build your own holiday ornament workshop where you can get advice on building tips and build an ornament to take home. Or you're looking for a fresh summer camp idea for your kids.What's the history of the brick? What does 3001 mean? Find out with interactive displays, detailed layouts and more information than you knew existed!Do you like art? View, purchase, or even sell your art at BRIX! And don't limit your media to just LEGO. Paintings, wood carvings and wax sculptures inspired by the plastic brick are all welcome.ŒæPrivate funding is secured but we also want to make this project available to the public to support. With what is available we can open and be ready to operate, but at a very limited scale. We aren't interested in loans. We'd rather take that money that would be spent on interest and invest it back into our guests and visitors. And supporters!ŒæWe have negotiated a great lease rate on aŒæspace. As members of PortLUG there is no shortage of people that are willing to help us set this up and make it happen. We have friends of all skills and backgrounds that are helping us make this dream a reality including a teacher, a LEGO historian, and a business woman.The majority of operating expenses will be covered by visitors to the museum experience. A retail store will also bring income as well as camp, classes, and events throughout the year. With this income we can continue to improve the experience and expand. We also plan to invest back into the local community by hiring employees and participating in philanthropic causes.The question is not if but when. We will absolutely be securing the keys to our space in early 2017 and setting up the most amazing experience we can dream of. But we would love for you to be a part of this too. Whether you are looking for a unique gift for the LEGO fan in your life or to be immortalized in LEGO, we want to offer you an opportunity to join in with what we are doing.Besides the other rewards we're offering (many of which are exclusive just for us) we will also offer a once in a lifetime opportunity. When this campaign meets its goals, every single person who contributed will have their name added to a LEGO-built plaque that will sit right by the front door of the museum for everyone to see. Once this campaign ends though, that plaque will be closed for good. We will put all of our Kickstarter supporters names on there and never add another one to it, ever again. This is just one way we want to honor you for what you're doing here today.Everyone who contributes $5 or more will also receive an invite to our pre-grand opening, just for donors.What are we going to do with your money? First, secure our lease. Then we need to build it up with display space. We also need to acquire more collections and pieces. Not every display we want to set up can be ready on opening day; those will grow over time. See this spreadsheet for a detailed working analysis of how we will spend funds over the next 2 years.ŒæWe will also develop our education arm with a dedicated staff and curriculum built from the ground up. And the same brainstorming will also develop the events arm offering birthday parties, corporate events and the like.Finally our gift shop will include well curated items that will enhance your experience at home. The Mini Museum rewards being offered here are just the start of what will be meaningful items to take home.We appreciate your support but we also really appreciate you spreading the word!Huge thanks to Boone at Toy Replay for his mad production skills on our video and to Jason for letting us crash his LEGO room for the shoot."
402," ELIZABETHäó»S VISION...ŒæNew York City's First Flower Farm.This would be the first Specialty Cut Flower Farm within the five boroughs serving both the wholesale and retail markets. The owner and lead designer of the floral design studio SOLIDGOLDOK, Elizabeth Wetherbee, has been working in the floral industry for over 10 years. She has worked as a farmer for seven on Marthaäó»s Vineyard and a floral designer for ten in both Martha's Vineyard & New York City. She has produced, designed, and installed wedding and celebration events and now brings her expertise to the the City that never sleeps. The only place to shop for wholesale flowers is on busy 28th street, which mostly sells flowers that have been shipped from all over the world, that are grown using pesticides and have an horrible ecological footprint, not to mention a vastly shorter vase life than locally produced blooms. This is why NYC needs a sustainable and ecologically responsible flower farm.Elizabeth currently lives in Rockaway, Queens and has secured a 262,000 sq ft lot to farm and site the greenhouse in on Beach Channel Drive and Beach 85th street.ŒæŒæThis farm will be the first of many, serving as an example to New York and global markets that high yield production level urban farms can be both profitable and ecologically sustainable in urban environments when novel designs and niche crops are the focus. Help Elizabeth turn the ""City So Nice, They Named It Twice"" into a leader for innovative urban agricultural design and floriculture.ŒæFUNDING GOAL:ŒæThe proposed funding goal was intentionally set very low, Ms. Wetherbee has secured clients, space, farmhands and profitable species. She has a decade of experience starting similar projects with less. It is after all New York City! This base funding goal will cover basic expenses including  a small greenhouse,  tools, placing the seed order and delivering product to clients and buyers markets. Anything raised above the set goal of $6,000, translates into more square feet in production. With this goal reached, Elizabeth can get 80,000 sqft in production, equating to over 25,000 dollars of annual income, enough to reinvest   towards the goal of  a 60,000 sqft rooftop production greenhouse.ŒæŒæGREENHOUSE & TOOLS:Basic hand-tools and a tiller are already in use. One of the largest expenses will be the greenhouse. Luckily, Elizabeth has extensive experience building many types of greenhouses, including the proposed design; a 100 ft semi-permanent and the most affordable option for NYCäó»s extended winter season. Check the farm's evolution on our website for drawings, plans, and picture updates as this project grows.SITES:Œæ""Pop-Up Flower Farm"":ŒæThe first round of investment will enable a ""Pop-Up Flower Farm"" on a vacant lot in Rockaway (seen above), on Beach Channel Drive and Beach 86th Street. The site is absolutely beautiful, with a view of the city across Jamaica Bay. Proximity to clients, great sun, good soil and a stunning backdrop make this location ideal.ŒæWHY KICKSTARTER?""This would be the first completely self-sustaining, ecologically responsible 'zero-footprint' floral market of its kind. The reason I am interested in starting with a Kickstarter Campaign, is so that in ten years when these strides have been made, we can look back and say that it would not have come to be if it were not for the general public supporting such an endeavor. I hope that this will serve as an example to all artists and designers, that you can dream big and actualize your visions as long as you are able to voice it clearly to the world. Draw out your crazy ideas, they just might work. I understand that big things start small because I am a farmer. A tiny seed, given the right nutrients and care can grow into the most beautiful flower you've ever seen.ŒæSo, watch us grow from the ground up and soon you'll be smelling the freshest flowers New York City has ever seen!""-Elizabeth WetherbeeŒæ"
403," Dragons and art span all cultures and all time. The U.S. is failing in the craft field. We have taken Arts and Crafts out of our schools and away from mainstream learning. We are not doing a good job of passing on traditions and we are losing the stories of our past. The U.S. has limited craft magazine choices. You can find: Knitting, quilting, and scrap booking magazines in any grocery store. It is hard to find any other projects. At Dragon Art, we believe that the artistic traditions of our ancestors need to continue. So, we are creating a new Magazine. Dragon Art Magazine will show a variety of projects in every issue. It will feature crafts and art that the U.S doesnäó»t currently have a magazine for along with projects we all know and love. It will feature artisans working in the Art business today, and every project will have a link to a video so you can see how those artisans create their works of art. And, because of direct publishing, it is now possible for each volume to continue to be available to the public. So, skills can grow as the magazine continues. If you learn a skill in volume one, you may need it again in volume three, when you take it to the next level. With full instructions, and video links you will have the chance to learn crafting skills in multiple ways. We are trying to raise the money for production costs, paying for distribution, and hiring more artist. We are on track to release Volume one, in February."

We're halfway through the month, and we're less than half way to our goal. I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this project so far, and everyone who continues to support it with likes and shares!

405," Terminal Flux is a site-specific drawing that will be created at the Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center on the Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus in Virginia. My site-specific drawings are created on location, for that specific location, and last for a predetermined amount of time before they are painted over/destroyed. In conjunction with the transitory imagery, these aspects of the project offer a metaphor for evolution - moving the viewer through creation, existence, and eventual destruction.Your support for this campaign will cover the costs of executing the drawing as well as documenting the project through professional video and photography. (A time-lapse video of a previous project expanding on my concepts and process can be seen here)Terminal Flux will be created by drawing with graphite directly on the wall in the atrium adjacent to, and above the entrance to the Schlesinger Center. The drawing will be over 2o feet tall and 30 feet wide and features challenging architectural elements to work upon. This will be my largest site-specific drawing to date. I will create the drawing between January 9 and 20, 2017.  A time-lapse video will be created to document the entire process start to finish in addition to high-quality photographs of the finished drawing.  The drawing will be on display for approximately one year where it will be seen by thousands of visitors who attend concerts and art exhibitions at the Schlesinger Center, in addition to the Northern Virginia Community College students.Iäó»ve completed over a dozen site-specific drawings in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area; documentation from most of the projects can be found on my website. Iäó»m honored to be the first artist asked to create a site-specific artwork at the Schlesinger Center. Iäó»m confident that my previous successful experiences have prepared me to complete this project. There are many steps and considerations for working in each site, but the process is similar for each drawing. I begin the process with a site visit, where I look for interesting architectural details, which I will engage as part of the drawing.ŒæŒæŒæI complete a number of perspective drawings and sketches, and then proceed to make a number of studies in the studio to develop a vocabulary of marks for the drawing.ŒæŒæŒæOn the first day of drawing in the space, I will lay out the drawing and mask off areas of the wall. The drawing and masking process continues for several days until complete.ŒæŒæThe area around the drawing is then tented with plastic to create a äóìspray boothäó for the drawing, and the drawing is sealed with a clear sealant to protect it.  The tent and masking materials are then removed to reveal the finished drawing.I need your support to fund the expenses for this project. It's important to note that 62% of the budget will be used to pay arts professionals in my community for their contributions to the project which include photographic and video documentation as well as skilled labor for the install. ŒæThis is by far the largest component of the budget. Your contribution doesn't just support me, it supports five (or more) artists.The budget of $4250 covers the following:Northern Virginia Community College/Schlesinger Arts Center is not providing any funds as they currently do not have a budget for exhibitions or special projects. NVCC will be providing me with necessary equipment to access the space (cherrypicker, ladders etc.), which eliminates costly equipment rentals. "

408," NLS welcomes the 2016 Summer Residents: David Gumbs, Kelley-Ann Lindo and Susanne Winterling, three brilliant artists from Martinique, Jamaica and Germany with diverse art practices.Over the nine-week residency, Gumbs, Lindo and Winterling will bring their unique backgrounds in 3-D mapping, video, paintingŒæand marine bioluminescence together to create a responsive mental and social landscape that investigates the vulnerability of water-associated ecologies andŒætheir link to our individual and cultural experiences and memories.Aesthetically the artists approach the project with diverse materials,Œæcombining amorphous sculptural cues,Œæa lab aesthetic, and a focus on heightening sensibilities and consciousness within audience participation. The artists draw inspiration from Jamaica's marine ecology-- Œæparticularly bioluminescent algae and the conch shell, as well as the context of that ecology within human experience of water-- natural disasters, history, practices and politics.NLS provides organisational, career and infrastructural support with the provision of work space (visual and recording studio space), critical feedback and event programming. Your donations help cover the cost of their materials, accommodations and travel expenses for the project.More About the Artists:Susanne WinterlingWorking across film and photography, Winterling is known for installations that critically intervene in their surroundings, directing attention to the sensual and perceptual qualities of spaces, objects and the representation of realities. Winterling's most recent exhibitions include 'Nature after nature' at the historical Fridericianum, Kassel, 'Drift' at the Gallerie Parrotta Contemporary Art, in Stuttgart, and 'The Lulennial: A Slight Gesturay', in Mexico City. In her exhibitions, her interests include biodiversity, nature/culture, and subjectivity to technology. Opting for a poetical rather than a power oriented practice, Winterling focuses on the entanglement of ecology and politics. She is also one of the founders of the art collective Akademie Isotrop, and is a professor of contemporary art.David GumbsGumbs is a multimedia artist who approaches his practice through drawing, painting, photography, new media, and interactive video. He has taken part in several new media festivals including the Trinidad and Tobego Film Festival, the Transforming Spaces in Bahamas, the Biennale Internationale Däó»Art Contemporain (BIAC) in Martinique, and the Beep Bop Boop New Media Festival in Florida. In his works, he explores the offscreen of perception, memory, the cycle of life, the visible and invisible, and rhizome graphical macroscopic universes. Gumbsäó» polymorphic art reveals the interbreeding and hybridization process in the collective and individual unconsciousness in Caribbean imagination. His artistic approach is based on a famous quotation from XVII th century French philosopher and chemist Antoine Lavoisier: äóìMass is neither gained nor lost, merely transformed.äóKelley-Ann LindoLindo works in photography, videography and painting. She earned her Bachelors of Fine Arts in Painting at The Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts in 2015. Lindo serves as art counselor at the Bellevue Hospital and the Jamaica Council for People with Disabilities. She utilizes elements of fragility and abstraction to fuel a tradition of remembrance art, as she seeks to break the passivity of the spectator. Her work predominantly explores the memories and visual legacies that remain after flooding, and through the manipulation of fragile materials she demonstrates the susceptibility of memory and the necessity of recollection."

410," The NYC&T show is a labor of love, an homage to the sights, sounds, and feelings of New York. It stands for New York City & Tom (me). I have been working on the show for years, doing paintings, installations, and brainstorming ideas of different ways to depict the city in a bigger way than just a gallery show with pictures on the wall. I want the show to mimic the largeness and the compactness of the city.ŒæTo fully realize my vision, I need to enlist the generosity of people like you. We need capital to complete the construction of several installations. There will be a subway installation that will mimic the feeling of standing in the station while the trains go by, using audio and video. Pull up a stool to the bar, or cozy up in a corner booth where you can sit and watch the traffic outside the window. Pick up a newspaper or magazine from the newsstand and grab a table at the Italian restaurant outside the entrance to the subway. And of course, there will be paintings adorning the walls and sculptures filling the space. All of it has been inspired by my love for that city, and created by me, with a lot of help from my friends.To thank you for your help, we have come up with some gifts that we hope will entice you to pledge your support. Any contribution amount will help, and we have a wide range of gifts to choose from. Below are photos of what you can have:This mural was commissioned by the Original Hot Dog Place, in the San Francisco Bay Area, but is not typical of what the NYC&T experience will be. It's kind of a fun piece about New York, and it was one of the things that got me excited to visit for the first time.For $20, you can choose from a coffee mug with the show logo, a mousepad with a painting I did of the infamous Hotel Chelsea, or a pack of eight of the above postcards with a personalized note from me on one of them:ŒæTaxicab bowties, handmade by my daughter Miranda. She appears in the video above, and has been instrumental in making this show happen.We are offering prints of some of the pieces of art that will be on display:ŒæHere is the neon sign that could be yours for a pledge of $400:My love for New York City took root the first time I visited that great metropolis, when I was in my early twenties. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area during a time when it was still somewhat rural and quiet. Imagine my surprise, as I walked down the crowded sidewalks of Manhattan, and heard a deep rumble while the ground began to shake. As a Californian, my first thought was, ""Earthquake!"". I soon realized that it was the subway beneath my feet that caused the shaking.I have since been to New York City six more times, and the excitement and thrills have never diminished. It's changed so much over the years, but always somehow retains the essence of what it is: an international hub for commerce, finance, fashion, art, and entertainment. As a night-owl, I feed off the energy of the city to keep me going even during the day; I don't need any other stimuli. New York, to me, is the greatest modern city existing today, and I hope this exhibit can capture some of that feeling.Œæ"

412," We would like for American artist, Dale Chihuly to build an installation near where Pulse Nightclub is. After the tragedy that occurred June 12, 2016 we wish to bring back love, life and hope to the grounds ofŒæS Orange Ave, Orlando, FL. In memory of the victims and in effort to support all of those who were effected- their loved ones, the people of Orlando, FL, and the entire LGBT community.Chihuly's installations have been all over the world and are universally liked by everyone due to their vibrant colors, craftsmanship and aesthetic. Dale's passion seeps through his work.Art has the power to bring comfort and in doing so we aim to aid the healing process of the victims friends and family and the LGBT community globally. Rather than live in fear, we should support one another and honor love.Orlando is the first stop. It is in the United States, where Dale Chihuly and his team are based. Our hope is that if this becomes successful, we can continue this mission to install his artwork in places where there has been recent shootings or bombings by Daesh. Example- in Istanbul at the airport or Dhaka at the Holey Artisan Bakery cafe. This would fuel people to return to these places to look at Chihuly's work and in doing so, would bring life back to these places. The horrible events of Daesh have touched us deeply as the victims could have been anyone of us. Let us never forget.Art is one of the greatest means of consolidation and healing.ŒæDale's work has so much light and vibrancy, we believe this can help greatly with the healing process.ŒæŒæŒæFor more on Chihuly's work, visit his website:http://www.chihuly.com/"

With the trail as my guide, I share the path of creative venture through visual communication.  I use the medium of photography as a way to communicate this passionate story.  My focus is on expansive landscapes that marry the natural world with the human spirit.  Compositions express the narrative of truth, found in the beauty of the natural world around us.  I use the tangible complexity of light and shadows that dance off the mountains and lakes to have this visual conversation. Sharing this sanctuary filled with raw emotion with others is the mission.I have been selected to showcase my Range of Light collection of photographs that were taken while thru hiking the John Muir trail on the United States National Parks 100 year anniversary.  The premier showcase will be at the House of Blues in San Diego, CA on October 5 2016, featured by RAW Artist.  I will be selecting 6 photos of the Range of Light collection to get printed on Fuji Crystal Archival Pearl paper and face mounted behind acrylic at a professional photo lab.

417," As seen on:ŒæŒæŒæŒæWho are we?We are designers, artists technology wizards and makers of an international team. We bring diverse backgrounds to collaboratively design and build a stage andinteractive art piece to enable the local arts communities in Vancouver.ŒæŒæŒæWhat are we making?We're making a hanginginstallation that will have projection mapping upon it at IDS Vancouver, anannual interior design symposium.Œæ Everyyear the goal is to create a fully recyclable installation to reduce waste oncethe symposium is complete.Œæ In past years the design team for the center stage has choose materials which can individually be recycled and disposedof. This year, we are proud to partner with a local arts collaborative to entirelyrelocate and reuse the piece for years to come.The installation is anabstract representation of downtown Vancouver, made of recycled polystyrene andwood. A variety of graphic content will be produced and projected onto the manyfaces of the piece.Œæ The piece will besuspended above the seating area of the main IDS stage to create a uniquevisitor experience.Œæ But that's the beginning of this project. After the show in September, the installationwill be carefully taken down, and shipped to The Beaumont Studios where thisproject will live and thrive in the artist collective there.ŒæŒæŒæHow did this project come to be?Originally, IDSVancouver asked Stantec to design a main stage. It could be anything decorativeor the stage itself but they asked Stantec to ensure the design was recyclable.The designers decided to make something they would recycle in full to a secondentity. Who would that entity be? The hunt began for a location who could benefit from such a project. A stage perhaps? There wasn't going to be a design until the secondhome was found. A connection between Aubrey and Mimi lead to the conversationof designing a stage for The Beaumont Studios. Jude (founder of the BeaumontStudios) wanted to create a new venue space between the two buildings of theirblock suitable to have outdoor events. Stantec then knew they needed shade, a stage andsomething incredible to attract new guests from the street. Local Projection was born and we've been working diligently as a collaborative project team to bring this to fruition!What's the plan andschedule?We're going to buildthis as a team at MakerLabs in the beginning of September, then relocate andinstall at the Vancouver Convention Center September 17th, enjoy the IDS VancouverShow, disassemble and relocate to The Beaumont Studios to be built a secondtime for the local artists of Vancouver. The first party in the new venue willbe in October and announced at a later date. ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæWhat's our budget?We're building the mainpiece for about six thousand dollars. We have hard costs in rigging at theconvention center around eight thousand dollars and for renting projectionmapping equipment around four thousand dollars (we're unsure at this point intime).We've raised about ninethousand dollars so far - we know we can make it to the convention. Getting it to TheBeaumont Studios, we have lot more costs coming. We think about twenty thousandmore at this point. What's our budget?We're building the main piece for about six thousand dollars.

418," By moving from our old to the new Emergency Room I have received six stainless steel folding screens that were no longer used. At a later time, I thought I could replace the fabric by leaded-glass. While working on this project, I have chosen to fill a strip in the middle with glass which is soldered together according to the Tiffany process. I have reproduced a bamboo motif in the glass, because these plants are growing in the courtyard where the project is to be placed.  I have used furthermore all kinds of colors and profiles glass giving it a cheerful appearance. The ""Tiffany"" strip has a narrative character. It is a 'lifeline' with certain symbols such as 'love', violence, old age etc..   The entire workpiece is illuminated from the inside by a plurality of LED strips that are connected with multiple switching clocks. Day and night the artwork shows a wonderful, colorful spectacle.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ Bij de verhuizing van onze oude Spoedeisende hulp naar de nieuwe heb ik zes RVS kamerschermen gekregen die niet meer gebruikt werden.

Al werkende aan dit project heb ik er voor gekozen een strook in het midden te vullen met glas wat volgens het Tiffany procí©dí© aan elkaar gesoldeerd is. Omdat er in de binnentuin (waar het glas-in-lood scherm echt prachtig tot haar recht zou komen) ook bamboeplanten staan heb ik dit motief terug laten keren in de glas. Verder heb ik allerlei kleuren en profielen glas gebruikt wat het geheel een vrolijke uitstraling geeft. De ""Tiffany"" strook heeft meer een verhalend karakter met symbolen uit het leven zoals liefde, je huis en ouderdom. Het hele werkstuk wordt van binnenuit aangelicht door meerdere LED-strips die aan diverse schakelklokken gekoppeld zijn. Dag en nacht wordt het kunstwerk zo een prachtig, kleurrijk schouwspel.ŒæAlleen heb ik hiervoor meer dan ä‰å 2000,- materialen moeten kopen en er eveneens meer dan twee maanden vrijwel continue aan gewerkt.

420," A good artist has the need and the duty, to show his vision of the world and challenge people. I do not know if I'm right or not, but I want to try to show that the human being is not necessarily bad.ŒæWhat is the role of parents, family, neighbors and wider school, social security, nation, democracy? What do we do with our DNA, the DNA of our ancestors? These are the questions I ask myself.My installation project I is not designed for just intellectual elites. I want to show it to the whole world with free access to the children, who go to school and often do not understand why. To the workers of a factory, to offenders and convicts, to the middle-class who run into the void.ŒæThat's why I ask your help to achieve hardware support, but the most important is to find locations and support, to show and give the message to as many locations as possible, with the goal of free entry, regardless of age, race or religion.

421," Little ŒæStone MenThey have done their duty quietly for more than 10.000 years ; possibly even longer. A few are still being recruited to act as sentinels of direction. They have many names but they have more or less the Œæsame look: a small pyramid made generally with rough stones. Their English name is ""Cairn"" a Œæceltic word. ""Cuirid mi clach air do chairn"" is a Scottish Œæsaying Œæmeaning: ""I will put a stone on your Œæcairn"".Usually Cairns stand alone or Œæin a cluster of no more than three or four where footpaths cross. There are Œæhowever places crowded with several hundreds Cairns like in Moeltin ( Sud Tirol ) in Corsica or in Perí_ where they are called Apachetas. ŒæThey are generally rather small and are made with just a couple dozen stones. Perhaps Œæthese small heaps should not be grouped as proper ŒæCairns but should be considered Œæas ceremonial markings for a burial,or for an ex voto site. Maybe these smaller Cairns could be Cenotaphs: empy graves for those who never Œæreturned to their land having perished in battle or in exploration of Œædistant lands.Cairns usually are positioned Œæto mark a footpath or a mountain pass in areas above the tree line. ŒæCairns are useless in woods and forest where they can easily be engulfed by vegetation.. They are to be seen all over the world colonized by man. In Inuit territory which usually is rather flat Cairns are also used as Œæfood cache.I wish to organize an exhibition centered on Cairns and their offspring: the dry stone wall. The eventshould take place in Gressoney Saint Jean in Northern Italy right in front of Monte Rosa at 1600 metres altitude smack in the middle of Italian Alps near the Swiss border.The exhibition will be based on Œæoutstanding photos of Cairns. ŒæAn attraction will certainly be Œæthe stones scattered on the Œæpavement of the show room, which visitors will be allowed Œæto pick and try to Œæmake a mini Cairn. ŒæIn a short walk from the show room Œæit will be possible to examine Cairns built by myself with the contribution of Œæpassers byes and aficionados.It will be possible to attend a two days seminar on the subject in beautiful log cabins with fantastic food and panorama. It will be possible to book an overnight stay.Attendants will learn about the system used to interlock stones which are positioned without recurring to cement or mortar. Structures built with this technique generally are more durable because in an earthquake they are more elastic and watrer will not have a chance to freeze because it will run away immediately.We are planning to produce for the event a poster a book size catalogue and Œæa build your own Cairn explanation sheet .The main strenght of this project lies in the fact that I have personally built in the Gressoney area a celtic vortex, three Cairns and one chapel dedicated Œæto Saint Michael Arcangel. All built in the traditional dry stone technique. I am planning to have the exhibition in an open Œæspace in a charming chalet style building belonging to the municipality. ŒæThis exhibition will go on green light Œæafter I receive the ok from Kickstarter. By mid March i will know if I will be funded or not. If I don't get funded I will try to get some sponsorship and lower costs. As a painter I have had five personal exhibitions in Milano and I am quite in good terms with several art galleries. So I think that I will push on even in case of a Kickstarter ""default"". I think that beginning of May would be the best date..Risks and challenges.Every venture implies a risk. ŒæThe 100% safe adventure does not exist. Last fall I decided to take a walk to have a closer look of some little stone men. Then Œæknew very little about Cairns. When I passed Œænear one of them in one of my mountain excursions ŒæI realized that many had a sad Œædepressed look. If however I walked up to the sad Cairn to examine interesting stones inadvertedly patting it on the back (?) I felt a rocky smile surfacing like steam from a funnell. To cut a long story short Cairns need to be embraced just like trees..Maybe this theory goes a bit too far and runs the risk of Œænot being taken seriously. I don't think that it will stand a scientific test. However when I handle stones ŒæI feel lots of positive energy surging inside myself. In 20 years of lifting sizeable rocks I never developed back aches.ŒæThere is also the risk of being alone in mounting this exhibition. I was however able to recruit my cousin Francesca Notarbartolo di Villarosa who was responsible for the video and Antonella Macchioni responsible for editing the video. In case of unforeseen hitches they are qualified to lend a hand. There is a saying stating ""If something can go wrong, it will go wrong"" Œæ Bad weather, low attendance, a fir falling on the Œæroof, Œæare all possibilities however remote which could jeopardize the event.. The challege is Œæto Œæwork hard to minimiize glitches. publish all the documents which will be produced for the event. I have been chief editor of severall magazines so I am on familiar ground. ŒæWith your help I hope to be able to get across the message that Cairns are a strong link to our past when man probably was still Œæa hunter gatherer."
422," (EN version)FR : dí©filer vers le bas Jean-Pol d. Franqueuil's  äóVantage Points äó is a dialogue between two sculptures in the shape of faces located in two grand European cities, Strasbourg and Berlin. With their similar design, signifying the human truths common everywhere in the European Union, they are differentiated by materials and specific colors to each city : pink sandstone from the Vosges for Strasbourg and granite for Berlin. Through their eyes fabricated in glass, modern technology links the two faces, thus allowing visitors to communicate through a variety of means, such as a live audio-visual system or messages sent directly from their cellphones (two of many anticipated possibilities). The expression of their own reality at each site is transmitted to the other end of the connection.  This sculpture project invites observers to see the world from another's vantage point, revealing their differences as well as what substantiates their commonality. As viewers are transported, an immediate dialogue is established between inhabitants of these important cities of the European Community. Each sculpture is composed of two main pieces integrated into one face, symbolizing the spirit of community and unity of these great cities, leaving behind the divisions that troubled their histories and looking toward a future of openness throughout Europe.  Nestled in the structure of each sculpture, a series of projectors emit images that simultaneously overlay the inner side of the glass eyes. Connected to the Internet, this system proposed by Realisations.net in Montreal as the provider of the technological aspect of the piece provides audio-video-communication and messaging similar to that used by today's smartphones. Sensors capture movements in 3D following people's positions and motion in front of the sculptures. Cameras and microphones capture the surrounding scenery as well as audio, including speaking of passers-by. Each sculpture then broadcasts the visual and audio ambiance coming from the other city across the miles between them.  A 52 minutes documentary film is in preparation for an important French television channel. Bonobo Productions will follow in parallel every step of the sculptures creation till the äóì opening äó of their eyes towards each other. During several months, the production company will record the way each city is working its side of äóì Vantage Point äó before achieving the visual connection between the two art pieces. When the connection occurs through the 3D Internet system, Bonobo Productions will capture live each cityäó»s unveiling of its own sculpture as well as the visitorsäó» reaction to the discovery of the other sculptureäó»s surrounding. äó€ Œ‚ Le Regard de läó»Autre Œé est un dialogue entre deux sculptures connectí©es en forme de visages qui seront situí©es dans deux grandes villes europí©ennes : Strasbourg et Berlin. Elles adoptent un design semblable, pour signifier la ressemblance des ví©rití©s humaines oí_ que läó»on soit dans l'Union Europí©enne. Elles sont toutefois rí©alisí©es dans des matí©riaux et des couleurs spí©cifiques íæ chaque ville : le gríÂs rose des Vosges pour les mains de la sculpture strasbourgeoise, le granit pour celle de sa partenaire berlinoise. íó travers leurs yeux en verre, un dispositif technologique de pointe permettra une connexion et l'í©tablissement d'une relation entre les deux cití©s, aux visiteurs des deux lieux. Ils í©changeront des aperí_us de leur quotidien de maniíÂres varií©es et ludiques, soit par un systíÂme vidí©o en direct, soit par des messages composí©s depuis leurs tí©lí©phones portables pour ne citer que deux exemples.  Ce projet a pour objectif de prí©senter un regard sur les particularití©s qui entourent l'une et l'autre sculpture, en prí©cisant ce qui fait la singularití© de chacune, tout en valorisant ce qui les rapproche. En se projetant vers ce qui reprí©sente l'intí©ríÈt de l'autre, ou ses prí©occupations, une conversation immí©diate peut ainsi s'í©tablir entre les visiteurs de deux oeuvres. Chaque structure í©tant composí©e de deux piíÂces principales rí©unies en un seul visage, elle exprime le dí©passement des divisions qui ont troublí© läó»histoire de ces deux places europí©ennes importantes.  Nichí© dans la structure de chaque sculpture, une sí©rie de projecteurs í©mettent des images qui se superposent. Connectí© íæ Internet, ce systíÂme proposí© par Realisations.net íæ Montrí©al- en tant que fournisseur de l'aspect technologique de läó»ñuvre - offre audio-vidí©o-communication et la messagerie similaire íæ celui utilisí© par les smartphones d'aujourd'hui. Des capteurs relíÂvent les mouvements en 3D suivants les positions des personnes en mouvement devant les sculptures.

425," Art Gathering stages the world's premier art show for street-tattoo and contemporary works in Long Beach, CA aboard the Queen Mary. The projects featured are part of an initiative to generate support for select visual art projects worldwide. Projects are proposed by independent artists and selected by our jury.The raised funds will be utilized to cover the costs of buying and building the necessary scaffolding and panel infrastructure needed to build the very large 24ftT X 16ftW freestanding wall surfaces for our hosted Muralists, their transportation, supplies and fees. The additional funds will also be utilized for the transportation fees it takes to get the large installations that make up the RANGE sector onsite, and crews to build them. Once the mural paintings are completed, they will be photographed and turned into limited edition screen printed poster packs for our RewardsŒæ #3 - #6 Supporters.Upon completion of the event, the murals will be available free of charge for other art initiatives to host for the remaining portion of 2016. They then will be white washed and utilized for the future muralists that take part in Art Gathering.Our Mission: Art Gathering will launch the first of its kind; a curated multi-media art festival offering multi-media artists, tattooist, collectors and visitors and a one-of-a-kind art experience. It is our mission to advance the public awareness of and involvement in the art of tattoo alongside the visual arts; to provide an extensive program of exhibits which promotes new work and diversity; to foster a place in the art community for the exchange of challenging ideas and the nurturing of new work; to support artists of all mediums; and to encourage collaboration and cross-fertilization between artists in multiple disciplines with the goal of producing the ""New"" Contemporary mixed media art.

428," // german version below //Fences are present everywhere. They create separation, boundaries and borders. Often fences imply to keep distance and are being built to not be crossed. However they don't necessarily need to be repelling. Couldn't they just be a colorful partition along which people walk joyfully?In summer 2014, we, 10 architecture students from the Technical University Munich, Germany, realized a colorful installation to embellish the arrival situation at the S-Bahn station Munich-Neuaubing. Using various colored plastic bags which we then weaved into a fence, the beautiful reflections, the translucent appearance and the no longer visible storage area behind the fence resulted in many positive responses from the public.As this was only a 2 weeksäó» installation, we now have been invited to participate in the arts project äóìTandemäó in which we will be repeating this installation with more permanent materials.Initiated by the Chair of Visual Arts at the Technical University Munich in cooperation with the äóìLandeshauptstadt Mí_nchenäó and the äóìAktive Zentren Neuaubingäó students embellish various sites around the neighborhood Neuaubing-Westkreuz. We will reinstall a similar installation using more sustainable colored acrylic glass elements. Attached to a fence along a S-Bahn station we will visually improve the until now rather not welcoming arrival situation.http://eingangsfenster.wix.com/tandemIn order to be able to realize the project we need your help! As the material expenses are high and the processing costs are not cheap we are depending on the kickstarter funding in order to realize the project. Every Euro is helpful in order to get closer.The amount of funding received will determine the size of the project. The more money we are able to raise, the bigger the project will become.So fare we have calculated:  60ä‰å are worth 1sqm colored acrylic glass, cut in the fitting size including holes for the attachments. We would like to cover at least 25 sqm of fence which determines our funding goal. Any additional sponsoring will enlarge the project. We hope that with this installation and especially with the publicity about it we are able to raise awareness that not every non-appealing public place needs to stay like that. Sometimes we lack the ability to see the beauty or the absence of it just because we are already used to our surroundings.This fence could be realized anywhere and we hope that maybe people will follow our initiative and create more beautiful fences.Spread the word! Anyone can help by just sharing our project and showing it to the world.

429," My name is Amanda Topaz.Œæ I am an aerial artist and creator. Œæwww.rockitaerials.com For over twenty years I have hung from beautiful ceilings around the world as part of my work.Œæ It has instilled in me a deep appreciation for architecture.ŒæI was instantly inspired when I saw Gaudiäó»s hanging models at La Pedrera in Barcelona.ŒæEquilibrium is a living aerial sculpture: a representation of the lines of the human body in relation to the curves of catenary arches used in architecture from the 17th century to the present day.ŒæŒæYou can enjoy the sculpture for 30 seconds or for the entire 30 minutes as the bodies form kaleidoscopic patterns in the ropes.This is the second time I have exhibited Equilibrium and I am thrilled to be collaborating with the exceptionally talented acrobats of The Hybrid Movement Company out of Brooklyn, NY. ŒæŒæEquilibrium plays on the notion of Gaudiäó»s architectural models and presents it as a relationship to Human balance, form and senses.As an artist I was drawn to the idea of Gaudi using hanging models in considerations of equilibrium due to my experience as a professional aerialist, (Gaudiäó»s hanging models closely resemble a traditional circus apparatus).Œæ ŒæIn addition, challenges in regaining balance and equilibrium after losing %75 of my hearing also compelled me toward Gaudiäó»s investigation into the physics of arch equilibrium.ŒæŒæI lost my hearing over the course of 5 years when I was 30.ŒæŒæDuring this time I had to take repeated hearing tests. ŒæThe music I use in Equilibrium was composed by Aaron Taylor Kuffner aka Gamelatron and includes an actual hearing test mixed in.ŒæCUNY Graduate Center of Speech-Hearing Sciences is recording what is left of my OAE's (Otoacoustic Emissions) and matching the tones of my tinnitus to play in the entrance of the piece. ŒæThe frame of Equilibrium is 15 foot diameter steel wheel pieced together with over 800 nuts and boltsŒæwith 410 feet of rope hanging off of it off of 36 carabiners.ŒæWe need money to pay for the shipment of the installation, safe rigging, money for the artists hanging and money to cover insurance.ŒæŒæYour support is very appreciated.

430," We feel the intense need to go to Burning Man and build this installation there in the desert. This installation is a portal to other dimensions or gate to other worlds, while you can experience day at night and night at day to make them all connected and one, to blend dualism and see both of them overlapping each other at the same time. It creates the feeling of oneness with the universe, oneness with the earth and everyone all around you. This is how we learn compassion and love.The size of the installation will be about 28' in diameter and 12' tall. It is forming a a hexagonal shape with dark fabric dividing each sections. The experience can be individual or communal. At daytime, you will experience the sun beams playing with it and at night you will experience it's glow. It will be a magical moment to step on the infinity knot in the middle to enter the portal to leave this world. Or if you just spend more time around it, it will give you its beauty and calm nature.This is a project that wanted to be made, the inspiration came from a higher realm and it has been already started, but to be able to finish and make it happen, this is what we need:Buy more materials, including wood, fabric and miscellaneous supplies that still needed.BuyŒæa trailer to bring it down from New York to Nevada.Buy a solar generator and pay for Internet subscription to create live feed videos.Please help us make this happen! Participating in the Burning Man is all we need right now to start surviving meaningfully."
431," About this Project:It is important for us humans to appreciate and recognize our ability and utilize it. This is how we evolve as a race. We know that we can make sounds with our voice. From that, we created more than 6,000 languages to communicate with each other. We know that we see and recognize different shapes. From that, we created words, symbols, buildings and paintings that we all can appreciate. We know the human nose can distinguish up to 1 trillion different odors. From that, we have schools that train people to make food that not only taste good but smells good. We have people that specializes in designing perfumes, cologne, deodorant, body wash and shampoo that we enjoy smelling. We know that we can hear. From that we created music. However, I realized that in this current day and age. With the overwhelming amount of visuals and sound that the media feeds to us, we have forgotten how entertaining and useful our sense of touch is. Therefore, in this project I hope to remind people of this sense of touch. I hope that people will remember once again how powerful it is and how powerless we are without it.ŒæProject Treatment:Aims äóñ The aim of this project is to raise peopleäó»s awareness of the importance of touch.Methods äóñ The audience will walk through six room that are connected by a tunnel wearing a pair of earmuffs/headphones that is controlled by my radio signal. If I were to play out any sound , they would be able to hear it through the headphones. However, if I were to not play anything, the earmuffs/headphones would be powerful enough to block out all exterior sound. The audience will experience the loss of vision and sight to experiencing the importance of touch in our everyday life through the journey of room 1 to 6.ŒæRoom number 1 äóñ In this room, the earmuffs will play out overwhelming noise and sound of the city. Projection of colorful imagery of the city on one side of the wall while the other side is a big mirror allowing the audience to see themselves in the city.Room number 2 äóñ Transition from being able to see and hear to a loss of vision and sight. The sound of the city will slowly die down along with the vision until the room is pitch black.Room number 3 - This room is the first room the participant will feel the deprivation of sight and hearing. They will not be able to see anything or hear anything and there will be nothing in the room.Room number 4 - In this room, the participant will learn how to get around obstacles using touch. Obstacles will be between the entrance and the exit.Room number 5 äóñ After learning how they can orient themselves using touch. They will need to learn to adapt to different atmosphere. Plants, humidifier and mini fans will be placed in the room. Soil will be covering the ground. The change of humidity and temperature and texture of the ground will be significantly enhanced without sight and hearing. When the participant walk pass the plants, they will experience passive touch as opposed to the active touch in the previous room.Room number 6 äóñ In this final room, the exit will be significantly smaller with obstacles such as cling wrap or foam blocking the majority of it. They will understand the importance of touch for survival.Outcomes- The audience should be leaving the installation realizing how important touch is. They should be able to understand that without sight and hearing we can still survive. However without touch, independent survival would be impossible. Budget:Gallery Space - I will be exhibiting in Hong Kong. An exhibition space named The White Loft located in Aberdeen. I will be renting the space for a day and a half, half a day for setting up and one day for the exhibition. The rent for one day is $1710.64 AUD and half day is $1026.59. Therefore, it equals to a total of $2690 for a day and half.ŒæRisk Management :Due to the nature of the installation, a lot of potential danger can happen. I have enquired the Director of Claims from Prudential Hong Kong Limited. The premium for a one day of the third party liability insurance would cost around $170.50 AUD. Therefore it would bring the total estimated budget to:	Rent $2690 + Construction $7941.31 + Insurance $170.50 = $10801.81 AUDMap ofŒæInstallation:"
432," There is a beautiful natural hot spring pool in the mountains on the south side of Mt. Baker. I plan to fill the pool with herbal flowers, covering the entire surface area of the pool. Then make a still photograph of the flowers floating on top of the water. Possibly there will be snow on the ground depending of course on mother nature. ŒæŒæI will bring a few different models and subjects and place them in the photograph as well as shooting just the landscape itself. In the end it will be a short series of photos.Lavender and Chamomile have soothing qualities that compliment the serine mountain scene, and will create the most amazing herbal hot mountain bath that has ever been! Your contribution will go directly to the purchase of a large quantity of flowers, gas to reach the destination, and printing of the photograph itself.

434," After having been to Burning Man 3 times and driven a rickety art car that fell apart on me every evening, I decided ... IT'S TIME. I am creating an art car ... with YOU!The theme was easy, I wanted a flat platform to lounge with lots of pillows. For the politically correct, it's called the CUDDLE PILE. Then again being part of the ""Saints & Sinners Camp"", it really is a place to do whatever you'd like ;-)Then while in Truckee wondering thru cute shops, I saw this really comfy, round LOVE SOFA and knew right there and then, we needed this on top of our art car, integrated into the SHADE STRUCTURE.With all these parts set, we first called it a ""Flying Carpet"" but decided it would be more appropriately called the ""SINNERS LOFT"".Other ideas, plans & dreams ...So who is in?"

436," WHAT IS TRANSMOGRAPHY:Transmography is a sacred space, designed as a small temple/shrine. It is intended to be a thoughtful space, where users are invited to interact with several things within the space to change patterns they resonate with about themselves from negative to positive.PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF TRANSMOGRAPHY:This space is designed as a house-shaped temple. 8' x 8' footprint. We will be using jigsaws to cut mandalas into the plywood walls (sides). The outside rear wall will have the flower of life, waves, and fire painted onto it. The front wall (door wall) will have panels on each side of it that will be cut with seaweed/fire-type shapes.There will be several ways to interact with the space, including sitting down and interacting with one another in the space. The space is meant to dig up feelings of unworthiness and cleanse them, resetting them with positive intentions, actions, scents, sounds, and by talking it out with one another.It will be painted, and decorated outside with wind chimes, inside with crystals, buddhas, and singing bowls, as well as creature comforts (pillows, rug, carpet), and metal platter and urn in the center for burning one's negative statement. The two front corners will have fabric draped from the ceiling to floor; the two rear corners will have swaths of fake ivy running the length.Behind both of the lattice door panels, there will be bowls of small quartz crystals, and an offering for people to take one.The outside will have LED lights lighting up the rim of the mandalas, and the archway. The inside will be lit with a lamp, and multiple strings of LED christmas lights from the roof beams.HOW ONE INTERACTS WITH TRANSMOGRAPHY:When you walk in, on the wall facing you, you see a list of phrases, as well as drawers that coordinate with these phrases. Phrase examples: ""I am not pretty enough,"" ""I am not very smart,"" ""I am not worthy."" The user will chose the phrase they resonate the most strongly with, and pull the coordinating drawer.Inside the drawer is two things - a paper copy of the negative statement, and a laminated copy of the opposite, positive, affirming statement. The negative statement is taken to the center of the shrine where there will be an urn, and it is burned. The positive statement is a keepsake, a reminder.The wall to the right as you walk in will have a mirror, and the statement ""See yourself five years from now. What would he/she say to you?""There will be notebooks, pens, and a place to write. You are intended to both write as well as read. This is an exercise in seeing one's potential future, changing it, and also seeing that the human experience is quite collective - as we might read some other words/advice in the books that resonate with us, left by others.The wall to the left will have jars with aromatherapy scents in them, to create associations of smell that lock the change in vibration/resonance into memory. They will be coordinated to the drawers, and also to the seven chakras. This wall will also house several positive statements, a crystal cluster, and buddha hand tea light holder. Above will read ""I Am Enough.""WHY WE'RE CREATING THIS:Burning Man 2015 left me feeling spiritually empty, for the first time in my 6 years going. The most satisfaction I got was participating in creating a tiny sacred space - one of the five ""Shiva Huts"" at Camp Conception. Feeling what people were experiencing as they interacted with it was exactly the feeling I was seeking on the playa, but never found. There was a lot of positivity and healing created in that hut.My partner and I want to bring this sacred space to Burning Man to share this quietude, contemplative thought, and introspection. It can be so much go, go, party. Which is wonderful, but contrast is so important to appreciating the full range of experiences at Burning Man. We want to give people the chance to connect to their spirit, and to their higher purpose. We want to give them the opportunity to slow down, breathe, and heal wounds, old and new.We hope to give them a refreshed and positive way of thinking of themselves, and others. We hope to give them insight into the lives and thoughts of others, and in knowing that others are experiencing similar things, give them the realization that we are all connected to each other, and that they are not alone. We want people to leave feeling supported, loved, and assured of self.Being able to give back to the playa what it has given to me is the greatest gift I can think of. Experiences like these have changed the course of my life, my passions, my life goals. My everything. I am ever grateful, and wish to deliver this to others. MORE PHOTOS / ABOUT US:ŒæWho are we? Two crazy burners from Seattle. My partner Justin has been to the playa 3 times. I'm at year #6. We are avid community builders and lovers of art, house music, beauty, and community. The last two years we've come with Camp Conception, and last year inspired me to do something much bigger than anything I had imagined prior. We decided to build this thing together, to share it's positivity with others.Us! Œæhttps://imgur.com/a/GtbiKŒæBack in the real world, we do our best to follow our hearts. We dance, we live, we sing, we love. We work, doing massage, selling crystals, and putting on music events and community-building, sustainable events (Seattle Clothing Exchange is my brainchild: https://www.facebook.com/groups/seattleclothingexchange/). It doesn't bring in a lot of dough, but we're following our highest excitement, and sharing our gifts and positivity with the world (our last jobs as marketer and electrician did not bring us happiness, nor promote what we loved in the world).

437," äóìFunctional artäó refers to aesthetic objects that serve utilitarian purposesäóîin other words, beautiful things that are also useful. We would expand that definition by adding to it things that are made to be useful but are also beautifuläóîwhat we term äóìFunctional Artways.äó  Decorated implements such as pottery and tools from archaeological sites show that people from the earliest days of human society have valued beauty in their everyday objects, and this delight in artistic expression carries through every era of human history to the present day.The original people of Appalachia were Native Americans of various tribes, largely Cherokee, who subsisted entirely off the land. From the 17th century on, they included hardy pioneers of mainly European stock who also relied on themselves and the land to provide the basic necessities of life. Today these frontier traditions are fading out, but the memory of them is kept alive in part through the arts and crafts their makers devised. Basket-weaving, pottery, wood-carving, textile weaving and fiber art, leather and beadwork, flint-knapping, quilt-making, blacksmithing, furniture makingäóîall of these functional artways are showcased here and there, but usually in isolation from each other and often in static museum exhibits. Our project, Functional Artways of Appalachia Throughout History, will connect the different functional arts and bring them to life by presenting a series of live, interactive displays and demonstrations over a two-year period, following an historical timeline chronologically from the Native Americans through today. These events will be held monthly and will feature an expert speaker/presenter who will demonstrate the skill and show examples. Many demonstrations will be hands-on, allowing active audience participation. The events will be filmed, edited, and posted on YouTube. They will be widely publicized, using social media and traditional print and TV media, throughout the Tanasi region including schools. The aim will be to build an audience, both äóìliveäó and online, who have a greater understanding of the arts and heritage of this unique place and the resourceful, creative people who made it their home. A parallel objective will be to make progress toward the ultimate goal of building a permanent home for the Tanasi Arts & Heritage Center by increasing public awareness of Tanasi. The individual event videos will be compiled into a documentary that will be offered to educational institutions throughout the region and shown in the Tanasi Gallery and eventually in the theater of the full-scale Center. They can also be used in further fundraising toward that goal. The costs of the project include an honorarium for presenters to cover their time and travel as well as materials used; the cost of filming and editing each demonstration; and a portion of the salary of the Gallery director who will organize and manage each event in coordination with the Tanasi Board of Directors. That's why we need your help with this Kickstarter project!"
438," We go to music concerts, then watch through our phones, stay in touch with relatives via a timeline and move gradually, more and more away from a tactile reality. Not so long along we used to take pictures and turn that memory into an object, the printed photograph, to treasure and pass on. My aim with The Tangible Pixel is to rediscover this process and literally build the picture, brick by brick.ŒæBUT... I NEED YOUR HELPŒæTo create the pieces in the series I need Lego/Duplo, and a lot of it.My aim with the series is to recreate the feelings of nostalgia people used to have for photographs, but updating it for the 21st century.I hope that by presenting specific images using Lego I can recreate the feeling of touching a photograph and connecting with the image on a more intimate level like we used to. The Lego also represents a time in childhood that was more active and present. When we used to play outside and build amazing worlds with the bricks and not be obsessed with phones and computers like this generation can be. I believe it will invoke a sense of movement back to something more tangible.People will be invited to touch the pieces and experience them much more presently that just looking at them.Iäó»m going to give myself at least a year to complete an initial series of 10 pieces.Each piece can range from 2000 äóñ 40000 individual bricks, so I believe it will take me at least this time to amass enough Lego to finish the series ready for exhibition. This campaign is to fund the completion of painting ONE.As all the pieces will be drawing inspiration from local landscapes and the community then I hope to approach local galleries to source adequate space."
439," Three Birds find a safe LandingAs the three owners of Paper Birch Landing we were brought together by the search for a safe haven to do our work in a setting where we could build community with other creatives. We are thankful to have landed in such a wonderful new home that is Paper Birch Landing. We work as a unit, helping each other achieve our dreams and as it turned out-- We all desire to to help other artists & writers  in our community. We believe a little compassion, faith and hard work goes a long way. Our goal is to show local and emerging artists' work, and provide a community space for creative people to meet for classes, art parties, shows, writing workshops, book launches, retreats, and more. Our new space has a roof top terrace for live music and plein air painting in the summer. Our classroom is open all year. Our fireside gallery and study serve as a writing space for writers who need to get away while showing four juried shows per year with wall rental space available for artists to show. We want to promote the artist over art. And bring community to artists of all kinds, right here in the Œæheart of Kansas City.Œæ"
440," äó¢ In January 1976, the first issue of PUNK Magazine #1 was published. It changed the world. That first issue created the anti-disco movement, transformed Lou Reed from glam-rock burnout into äóìThe Godfather of Punk,äó and heralded The Ramones as the most important punk-rock band in the world. Its hand-lettered graphics also inspired a fanzine movement that featured many more crude and badly-produced fanzines, such as Englandäó»s äóìSniffinäó» Glueäó (by Mark P.), äóìRipped and Tornäó (by Tony P.) and Scotlandäó»s äóìNext Big Thingäó (by Lindsay Hutton), as well as äóìSlash,äó äóìFlipsideäó and äóìSearch And Destroyäó in the USA, among many, many other äóÖzines across the universe.  äó¢ The first issue of PUNK Magazine was developed, created written, drawn and printed in a very short time: Mid-November 1975 to New Yearäó»s Eve 1976. It appeared three months before the Ramones first album and a year before the first Sex Pistols record were released. It didnäó»t cash in on a popular movement; PUNK Magazine created it.  äó¢ The radical look of PUNK magazineäóîhand-lettered editorials and page layouts, feature articles presented in photo-comic formats, and a cover that caricatured Lou Reed as a horror comic iconäóîcreated an authentic visual ""punch-in-the-mouth"" for what we insisted was a genuine social movement, and it became a knockout. äóìPunk Rockäó before PUNK magazine appeared was a vaguely-defined term that described the New York Dolls, the Bay City Rollers, AC/DC, The Standells, the pub-rock bands popular in England at the time (Eddie and The Hot Rods, The Stranglers, etc.), and many mediocre rock bands who appeared atat CBGB. After PUNK Magazine appeared, punk rock was about the Ramones, The Dictators and the Dead Boys in the USA and the Damned, the Sex Pistols and The Clash in the UK. Thousands of great bands have emerged since then. äó¢ PUNK was the first media outlet that viewed the downtown scene at CBGB as more than just a new music scene: It was a social schism separating the previous late äóÖ60s-based rock culture that was dominating the East Village at the time and replacing it with a new aesthetic, based on the original bohemian and beatnik elements that preceded the hippie movement. In other words, PUNK foresaw a ""New 'Hood Order."" Within a few years, most of the hippie shops in the East Village had disappeared and a few dozen punk rock shops were doing good business. äó¢ŒæPUNK Magazine was often descibed as a äóìfanzineäó in the 1970s, suggesting a small circulation and a limited editoiral viewpoint. In fact PUNK was a legitimate newsstand publication, publishing 25,000 copies that went to newsstands and subscribers before its demise a few months later. Although it sometimes utilized the elements of fanzines for parody, PUNK would be more properly described as an äóìartzine.äó It was definitely the first äóìpunk äóÖzine.äó inspiring many other magazines and fanzines in its wake, notably äóìSniffinäó» Glueäó and äóìSearch And Destroyäó in England, and äóìSlashäó in the USA.äó¢ On January 14th, 2016, PUNK magazineäó»s artists, cartoonists and illustrators will mark the publication of the first issue with a group gallery show at äóìHowl! Happening: An Arturo Vega Project,äó located in the heart of the East Village, a stoneäó»s throw away from where the CBGB club and Arturo Vegaäó»s loft (where Joey and Dee Dee Ramone lived with him in the 1970s) were located until a few years ago. äó¢ This kickstarter campaign will enable fans of PUNK (and non-fans who think this is a good investment), to purchase stuff from the Howl! Happening gallery space, as well as PUNK Magazine stuff. For instance, PUNK #19, which featured The Bullys on the cover, will be a more interesting item now that the bandäó»s music can be heard on the PUNK kickstarter video. Theyäó»re great, right? äó¢ The exhibition catalog will include writing from James Wolcott, Steve Heller and Carlo McCormick, as well as an article about Ged Dunn, Jr., PUNK Magazineäó»s founding publisher (by John Holmstrom), as well as lots of graphics and stuff from the original PUNK Magazine and details about the artists in the show: Each of them contributed to cover images for PUNK. I think this catalog will become the next PUNK Magazine collectible. As everyone knows, our back issues sell for too much money on eBay, well, this is an effort to reprint them and make them more accessible. So if we make enough money from this kickstarter, we can plan reprinting other issues. But we will need a huge response to do that, reproducing PUNK #1 and putting together this kickstarter campaign? UGH! Too much work! Okay, thatäó»s our pitch."

We love riding our motorcycle and one night we had a scare when a driver did not see us and almost ran us off the road. That sparked a conversation on how many riders had the same problem. We decided to use this idea as the basis of our business. Keeping the rider safe. We decided to follow this idea by using LED lights to make ourselves more visible. After the installation was complete, we had various compliments as well as interests from fellow riders on the idea. We decided to make it our Goal to make this work and be able to save lives and keep drivers and riders visible to each other. M&M Cycles PHX was Born.Our goal is to create and Maintain a Business in which customers can have the piece of mind that they will be seen at night. We stand behind our business so well that we will offer LIFETIME WARRANTYon our lights yet affordable enough that anyone can have this great feature. We have converted our home garage into our shop with intentions of keeping a low overhead in order to keep costs down.

449," The project is a 9m x9m light up naughts and crosses game. When the game is not running the structure doubles as a stage for Fire dancers who will perform in stints when the naughts and crosses game is 'having a break'. The structure may have to be reduced to 7.5m x 7.5 m for structural purposes. Our project is entered into Artweek Auckland 2015 and is going to be a visual spectacle along Devonport's waterfront. We have plans, models and renders of the project produced and ready to be submitted. Our installation will be interactive and great fun for all. The game will be in the heart of Devonport and is sure to entertain anyone wanting to come down. We currently estimate that the structure will cost around $2-3000. The main cost involved is scaffolding. Our pledge of $250 will be a great start! All donations help and we would love to hear any feedback or queries on the project!XOX artweek team"
450," I have made mazes and puzzles for fifteen years, at the rate of about one a year. They are complicated mazes that include doors and locks, with changing aspects.They have been in different materials owing to the fact that I just seek out and find something that there was a lot of and could work with a raw design. They have been made from cardboard, sheets, plastic, string, pvc pipe, ceiling tiles, wood, metal, paintings, and a few others. Most of these have been full size mazes, some have just been models.The newest iteration relies on a modular platform design. This will make it expandable, portable, adaptable, and mostly, will allow for various different activities and features for the maze. It also makes it a bit more of a spectacle. By having its own elevated stage, it lends itself to having spectators with a vantage point. I have begun writing a play that takes place in this iteration. While the play has a definite plot, it serves a dual purpose of demonstrating how it works, so at the end of the play, the audience is invited to try it for themselves. ŒæFor the rewards:The first tier reward is a soul-felt thank you, and an invitation to watch regularly scheduled posts either in video or picture format of the project.The second tier rewards are handmade stickers with simple designs,Œæand an invitation to watch regularly scheduled posts either in video or picture format of the project.The third tier rewards are handmade t-shirts andŒæan invitation to watch regularly scheduled posts either in video or picture format of the project.ŒæThe t-shirt design is not finalized, but would have a lot in common with the sketch.

452," With all of the turmoil and suffering focused on by the media nowadays, I think it's important to take a step back and think about things we are grateful for. The goal of this project is to do just that. I will be traveling the globe, starting in Jerusalem, creating art installations that represent a type of love and community that we as humans need to all be thankful for. I will make sculptures, street art, produce impromptu street performances, and make working mechanical models of scientific concepts which have a direct impact on our lives. I will focus the meaning of these pieces on the development of humanity as a species and will incorporate wisdom and tradition from all religions, ancient and modern, in order to produce pieces of art that will force dogma aside and create an understanding that we are not so different after all. An example of a piece that I would like to create from the get-go, is a life sized statue of the compassionate Buddha meditating that will be installed in the mount of olives in Jerusalem. On the base of the sculpture it will say ""Nor will people say 'Here it is' or 'there it is' for the kingdom of God is in your midst."" Luke 17:21. The goal is to create understand that the teachings of Buddha which state that Nirvana is a journey inward and Jesus who says that the Kingdom of God is within, are not so different, and in reality all of the dogmatic reasons for which we fight are out of fear, not understanding. At the same time, while I have all of these ideas, I would appreciate ideas from supporters so I can better create installations that encapsulate the ideals and beliefs of people from all over the world. I will add that if anyone who sees this would rather travel and volunteer their time and services then please email me. I would appreciate spirited and brave volunteers to help me in this venture. The goal is to create 50 installations by July 2016."

Our project is to buid a  galvanised steel  structure, 15 meters by 9 meters with a height of 3 metres. Inside the structure, about 100 photos will be exhibited (40/60cm  on Dibond), photos  shot during  the weeks  prior to the 18th december, representing  the inhabitants of The Jungle. The structure will be put up with the help of inhabitants. After the 18th, the structure will be left behind and will be at the disposal of the associations and the inhabitants. It is a  solid structure , approx 150 square meters which only needs to be covered./tarpaulined. The idea behind this project is to build a memorial dedicated to the the inhabitants of the Jungle. Symbolically, we will be building an open-sky house which will bear witness of the passage of the people who have transited through the Jungle.This project was born from a collaboration between Elliott Causse and Dadave, at the Fines art school of Paris.Link to the original project :Œæ https://vimeo.com/141110439The surface of  it is 9m2, our installation will be 15 times  that surface... In practical terms , it will take about one week to build  with the help of 15 people, 5 from the Collective  and 10 more from The Jungle.Œæ'' Should people's mobility throughout the world be synonym of  life as second class citizens, or inclusion or  assimilation? ''. ŒæMigrants  in calais are shown as a huddled mass of thousands of men and women waiting to cross the Channel to reach Great Britain. Hiding in the backs of lorries, holding on the axles, walking in the Tunnel, trying to imagine a new life. Of these men and these women who  have fled from poverty, oppression, ignorance (obscurantism), persecutions, warfare, who have faced  hatred  or indifference  during their exhausting journeys (exodus), we are only shown photos of distress and death. Pictures of survivors from hell.ŒæAnd yet  each one of these women, each one of these men  have an individual destiny, moulded by beliefs, love, wounds, educational principles, poetic aspirations or philosophical  convictions. Many are students, engineers, bank employees or teachers, whose families  have saved and gone without  so that their loved ones could undertake  their journey to a better future.ŒæJungle House is a testimonial.ŒæJungle House is a memorial dedicated to the inhabitants of the place , using photography as a medium to exhibit their itinearies, their hopes, their projects and  their doubts, their humanity !ŒæJungle House  as the expression of an emergency  :  emergency  for  an artistic response  to awaken conscienceness, fight  against numbness of consciences and  build a  rempart against oblivion. For as Tocqueville once said ' when the past does not shed a light on the future , then the soul walks in darkness''.ŒæŒæJungle House wants to confront  Art and Politics  so as to promote  an awareness of the isuues  and  question the state of our  human societies.  The proposition, enscribed as it is in the recurring current issues , will develop and expand according to the artistic responses (and productions ) to the place. The purpose is to promote the idea of otherness (alterity) in creation as a reflection of  human alterity. The purpose is to offer new reading tools  which will help decypher the collective  misconceptions on immigration, which  will help go beyond  set ideas  on the integretion of immigrants and which will promote individual ideas..  Finally , the sensitive responsiveness of the  artists' works  creates the space necessary for our conscienceness to develop. Nothing is easy and simple: multiplicity of languages, words are encryptioned or whispered, ;the new paths sometimes lead nowhere, sometimes become bridges between the shores, reflections of our most intimate feelings and political spheres.Stephane Weisselberg"

ŒæThe tree will be made from a high quality vinyl with a matte finish and applied so that the completed piece will look like it was painted on my wall. Approximate measurements are estimated to be 112'' wide x 83'' tall but may be vary depending on the number of final leaves to be added to the tree.ŒæWhen the project is successful, a survey will be sent out based on the final pledges and rewards to request your wishes. Each wish can only be a positive thought. Wishes that involve causing someone else harm or are negative in any way will not be included in The Wishing Tree.ŒæWishes that are too long to be written on a leaf will be summarized and the essence of the wish will be written on the leaf instead of the actual wish.The Wishing tree will be installed on my dining room or living room wall in open view of anyone who passes it. Each time someone sees the tree, they will be encouraged to read the wishes and visualize them coming true for you. The tree will be displayed for at least 1 year.AŒæpicture of the final work of art after installation will be shared through an update with all those who pledged. It may also be shared via email or a link to a Facebook page.$2000 Stretch Goal: Pictures of the tree's growth will be documented on a website, Facebook page or blog and original wishers will be encouraged to share any updates regarding the status of their wishes.Allocation of funds:Œæ$550 will be used towards the commission of an artist to design and cut the vinyl and my time to write the wishes and install the trunk,Œæbranches and leaves on my wall. Any additional funds received will be used towards expanding the tree with additional leaves, my time for the installation and maintaining the Wishing Tree website/blog if the Stretch Goal is reached."

457," #theselfproject  is a fine art sculpture installation that uses the viewer and social media as a medium like no one has ever done before. Based off selfies, #theselfproject exists to delve into the thought of why people take, what we are thinking and how the behavior of taking selfies has done to our humanity. Is it an action that has made us more sharing of a society or has it made us more self absorbed and narcissistic? I wish to treat this question as a psychological study similar to those conducted in the 1950-60's. The day and age of smartphones our behavior and interaction with others has changed forever. I wanted to ask the questions how has this changed us, what do people take these images, what do we share them with not only friends and family but also with perfect strangers as well as what about these images do people relate to making them share and like these images. The phrases in these 10 mirror sculptures are meant to be self reflective pseudo questions that the viewer can relate to at that particular time. These phrases are omitted from the reflective surface of the mirror to make parts of the person seem to disappear. This lends to the thought that the phrase and the person are codependant. Placed in public setting traffic , people and other elements of the setting can also be seen in the mirror implying that all of this is part of a larger equation. Being that the genisis of taking selfies was done in a mirror, the viewer is encouraged to take a selfie, use the has tag #theselfproject and upload it to social media such as Instagram and Twitter where I can now have a library of those that participate in the project. By doing so I can couple these images together under each phrase and show the commonalities of people regardless of sex, race, age, orientation or economic background. We live in a world where we find many ways and many issues to create a wedge between our fellow man. I want this project to be one that, even in a small way, shows that we all go through the same core emotions and are a lot more alike than we perceive.The project will debut in Grand Rapids Michigan for the 2015 Art Prize however it is designed to travel to at least 10 cities nationally and internationally. In doing such I wish to shoot a documentary asking these questions, getting opinions from regular people, social psychiatrists and sociologists and show the progress of the project. I intend on publishing a book about the project as well.This is a very unique project for a number of reasons. 1, everytime someone takes a selfie they create a new piece of art. This piece/picture would not exist if it were not for that particular person. 2, to the best of my knowledge no one in fine art has deliberately used social media as a medium for fine art in this way. This has the potential to have 10's of thousands of individual works of art/images generated from these 10 sculptures as well as millions of impressions. For me, I  am excited to see various people get involved and build this community of sorts.I have a strong belief that what I create isn't necessarily the art. The art, the beauty comes from the emotions, interest, conversations, debates and interactions the work evokes. My work is simply a catalyst.  Please help me make this vision a reality. Get involved. Donate. Follow me on Instagram  and Twitter where you can find me @clevelanddean. Also follow the project via my website www.imadeyoureadthis.com. Thank you for your time, appreciation, participation and donations."
458," Update 8/6/2015ŒæHello Burners and Friends of Burners! ŒæSad to say, our Kickstarter failed to meet the funding goal, so we will not get any support from this venue. ŒæI guess there's too many other great projects going on, and I am more focused on getting things done than running around promoting like crazy. ŒæNot to worry, we are still going, everything will still be beautiful and amazing, and the only downside is a big hole in my personal finances, but heck - its Burning Man - it always costs more than you think it will.But...if you still would like to help out and also still get one of the amazing rewards offered, you can do directly to my website where we still have everything available, but just without the Kickstarter framework. ŒæAny and all support is greatly appreciated, and we will see you on the Playa!!! ŒæHere is the support link, which will become active 8/7/15:Œæhttp://truemirror.com/bm2015fundraiser/ŒæJohn Walter, lead artist...and now back to our story:The theme at Burning Man this year is the Carnival of Mirrors, so we are going all out with the redesigned and upgraded True Reflections Palace. ŒæThis isŒæa wonderful space that showcases amazing true reflection mirrors thatŒæshow you without reversing left and right. ŒæA truly tinkered view of you and completely mind blowing! We discovered that these mirrors allow you to See Yourself - Œænot just what you look like, but who you are and how you are. ŒæThis will be our 10 year anniversary at Burning Man, and we are ready to rock the Playa with some amazing art and beautiful interactivity!Traditional mirrors take all of our vitality away and present a flat and distorted version of ourselves. We are used to this version since childhood, but it is so wrong - we are much more than what is in backwards mirror reflections.In contrast, looking into your own eyes, in real time, without that reversal does something surprising - our eyes and faces keep ""working"". ŒæWhatever we are saying looks right, so we can keep saying it. ŒæThe net effect - you get to See Yourself. The real you, the one that we see. ŒæIt can be stunning to realize how much more alive we are than what we have seen in traditional mirrors our entire lives. ŒæIt's a function of right brain/left brain theory, facial communication and feedback loops. ŒæThere is both science and magic here, and on Playa it gets both explained and experienced to a degree unlike any other place on earth.This year we have been selected as one of theŒæBurning ManŒæHonorarium Art Projects, which has not only helped get us there, but given us amazing visibility for the full 8 days...placement on Inner Playa!This presented both a challenge and opportunity - the Palace clearly had to be made bigger, plus the Œæ4x4 and 2x4 construction was getting old. ŒæFive years back and forth to Playa definitely takes its toll, plus the creative itch was was crying out for something new. ŒæSo what else can one use to build a 20x30x8 foot cube? ŒæJohn Walter, aka Exactly, the lead artist, came up with the perfect solution...what about using life size versions of those wooden building toys from childhood? They should be able to work (aside from the fact that they always fall apart - basic engineering additions could fix that).ŒæAnd so the planning and testing began, first in trying to make the wood rounds with a tree trunk, then by doing it right with a woodworker who makes wood columns by trade. Œæ Then joining with 10 foot long poles covered in colored spandex, then colored curtains on the outside, and finally ""cross-beams"" for strength, and voilíæ - a brand new design that will be pretty kickin out there! ŒæForm, Function and Art all rolled into one. ŒæAs a bonus, the colors will make it truly look like a Carnival Tent!In the spirit of of the 10 principles of Burning Man, we are Gifting an amazing, wonderful and completely unique experience to thousands of people. ŒæRadical self-expression is often the result as people look deeper and interact with themselves as never before. ŒæAnd Immediacy? ŒæWe are Œæall about removing a barrier to recognizing your inner self and how you truly are to the rest of us - you can turn around and be yourself so much better from this experience.ŒæPrepare to be surprised if you have never seen this before...you as a real, vibrant, truly alive and happy human being. ŒæOr a deep and genuine Burner with wisdom in your eyes.  Or whatever - your true image actually reflects all your expressive information correctly, so you can continue to be true to yourself. ŒæThe experience is wonderful - as one burner said: Œæ""When did I become the bright capable soul that this mirror shows?"". ŒæOr another: ""I find myself liking what I see...and I find myself loving that concept"". ŒæOr even better, from a 5 year old: äóìWhy are my eyes shiny in this mirror but not in that mirror?äó ŒæSays it all! ŒæEven more comments below really tell the story and why this actually is super important work we are doing. We thank you in advance for your support of our vision.We are looking for Kickstarter funding to supplement our other funding sources, especially since the project has grown quite a bit since our initial budget. ŒæFor instance, in addition to the main Palace installation, we are going to to put True Reflection Mirrors at the Purel stations on 15 radial streets at Avenue D. (aka Daily Mirrors with Affirmation Tabs). ŒæBecause mirrors will be everywhere this year, might as well put true reflection mirrors where they can be easily used, just like any other mirror, just so much better!ŒæThe entire project has already topped $20,000, and we are only partially funded from Burning Man and some wonderful donors so far, including from the lead artist. ŒæBasically here is a cost breakdown:The rewards are coming directly from the hands of the lead artist and photographers connected to the project. ŒæAs part of John's lifelong mission to bring these mirrors to the world, he does make them commercially as True Mirrors. ŒæWhat makes them so special is that the distracting line in the center of two ordinary mirrors at right angles is virtually invisible, and it can be mounted on the wall just like any other mirror, just so much better.Œæ Note: this is the only place in the world to get this kind of mirror...its actually quite difficult to make them perfect, but we think it matters that we do.The production 12x12"" model is offered here at a discount from the regular price, and the beautifully decorated one from Michele Palmer will be an amazing addition to any household, and the handcrafted wood 18x18"" models will be gorgeous. ŒæOn Playa, our $50 reward is to have your portrait taken inside the True Reflection mirror. ŒæWe have been blessed to see so many incredibly magical people with real sparkles in their eyes - something that is rarely seen in even regular portraits. ŒæCapturing the essence of who you are can be a lifelong treasureFinally, the Liquid Nitrogen Fractured First Surface Bas-Reliefs are the result of a failed experiment that became beautiful art instead. ŒæTrying to get better cuts, John experimented with making the glass very cold...as in Liquid Nitrogen cold. ŒæDidn't work - the glass fractured into many pieces. ŒæBut they were perfectly fractured - you could put them back together like a jigsaw puzzle. ŒæSo he mounted them on a black background and framed them for Œæcompletely unique wall artŒæBonus - VIP Entrance: All contributions over $25 get VIP entrance to the Palace if there is a line, and we expect one almost all the time. ŒæNote: this reward only works if there is someone at the ""velvet rope"" to take your VIP pass - since this is a 24x7 installation, there will be plenty of times there will be no one at the gate...so sorry, for those times you will have to wait with others.ŒæHonor Roll - all contributors will have their names on a large poster inside the palace as another thanks and recognition of your support - even the smallest amounts mean a lot to us, it goes a long way to showing how you value this experience, both at Burning Man and elsewhere.The True Reflectors Crew consists of amazing people who have been part of previous year's installations and/or those who are so moved by the experience that they are completely ready and willing to bust it both here and on Playa. ŒæSuper grateful to everyone!"

Eventually it will be an Eco-CampgroundIt seems that the world is developing at a fast rate these days; open land is becoming more and more difficult to find. We have been warned by environmentalist that global warming in on the rise, but are we doing anything to slow down the process or protect what is left of our land?I would like to help to try and help reverse some of the damage that we as a human race have done. I would like as many people as possible to help me do this as it is too much for one person to do alone. I would like to acquire a large piece of land up north where trees can be planted, or replanted. I also hope to be able to purchase the mineral rights of this land as well, to ensure its protection. This land will be used as a camping ground which will run solely off of solar energy. If the land has any buildings on it, I would like to use some of the money to convert them to run on renewable energy as well. ŒæI have contacted the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in order to gain a Dark-Sky designation talks are still on going. With the urban life we live, we need more places where we can look up and be able to see the stars; a place where we can escape the chaos of our daily lives. More can be learned about this at https://www.rasc.ca/content/torrance-barrens-dark-sky-preserve.I hope that we can work together to get this project going, and so that we can start planting trees rather than digging them up. ŒæThis project won't happen over night as I need to gain the proper plot of land plus the mortgage but with your donations its a start."
462," Many of us grew up playing with LEGO bricks, but eventually we are forced to leave behind our childhood and set off in search of meaning, success, wealth, love. But the journey of adulthood is often difficult and harsh, and sometimes you really just want to play with some LEGO bricks.Inspired by Legoizer after I saw it on Reddit, I set out to create my own LEGO mosaic generator with more customizable options (e.g. dimension, color, brick types) in order to recreate one of my all time favorite paintings, TheŒæGreat Wave off Kanagawa («_Î«šÎ‡____µÈ£), in LEGO bricks.After a combined total of few days of intermittent hacking during which I incidentally received my college degree, I built  Image to Brick,Œæa functional JavaScript tool that produced the build instructions more organized and configurable than the ones produced by Legoizer.There were a few reasons why I felt necessary to build my own tool instead of using Legoizer. If you are curious, I talk about them in greater details in this blog post: http://soraven.com/2015/07/20/why-i-made-image-to-brick/Having completed Image to Brick, I have taken the first concrete step I needed to realize my life-long (2-month-old really) dream of being an adult practitioner of the LEGO arts. Huzzah. But the hard part is yet to come.At this point in this story, I came to the realization that LEGO bricks are hella expensive -- I would need around 9,000 bricks just to build a 5äó_ 3äó_ x 3äó_ 3äó_Œæ(160cm x 100cm) sized mosaic and I was hoping for something a little bigger than that. At $0.10 to $0.40 a brick depending on type and color plus shipping, this can add up fast. I will probably also need to build/purchase a flat supporting surface for the base plates.I realized that I don't quite have the disposable income to do this, but by this point I am already in too deep. Having done the research and spent countless hours on this endeavor, the vision of a LEGO Great Wave was rapidly becoming an obsession. I want to see this thing in the real world. I want to touch it. And possibly lick it.I need money to make my vision a reality. I asked myself, ""Where can I find people with excess liquid assets who would give it to complete strangers on the Internet to do silly things like making potato salad?"" And here we are.Help me recreate this awesome painting in LEGO! The base goal will allow me to build a mosaic at least 3 feet high. I plan to adjust the build size upwards if the raised amount exceeds the goal or if more detailed cost calculations allow for it. These are the rough estimates:I plan to adjust the height of the mosaic in increments of 16 bricks because I will use 16x16 and 32x32 base plates to construct the canvas.I will be using a mixture of 1x16, 1x12, 1x10, 1x6, 1x4, 1x3, 1x2 and 1x1 plate pieces placed in horizontal rows on the base plate canvas to construct the image itself. I prefer this method over stacking LEGO bricks because each unit of LEGO is square and not rectangular and the result has a more interesting texture because of the exposed studs.If it proves feasible given the funding level achieved, I would like to explore the possibilities of building the mosaic in different layers. This would require more bricks and cost more, but the result might look more interesting.The tool I created does not directly support layering in generating the build instructions, so some manual tweaking and image editing will be needed to figure out how to produce the brick counts I need to create the effect. In the above example, I would probably use regular bricks for the blue layer, double plates for the purple layer and single plate for the red layer.The final deliverables for this project are:I hope to complete the entire project by December with most of the building work being done over weekends.Help me live the dream!"

464," Hello. My name is Marc Rees and I am a the curator of a small butbeautifully crafted,Œæentirely free, arts festival called LLAWN, located in the Queen of Welsh resorts ,Llandudno , North Wales .Œæ2015 will be its third manifestation and itäó»s growingfrom strength to strength. Our aim is to animate the whole of the town and toget everyone to embrace the arts: the local residents, the shop keepers and shoppers andthe seaside day trippers .ŒæFor the last two festivals we have utilised a central areain town called North Western Gardens, more fondly known locally as Bog island (either because Œæit used to be a natural bog or, possibly,Œæbecause it now houses the maintown toilets).ŒæThe siteŒælies opposite the derelict Tudno Castle Hotel, a venue thatwe also take over and open up for the festival .ŒæThere was a beautiful old oak tree in the centre of thegardens which became a focus for many of the festival's events butunfortunately it was severely damaged in a storm and had to be cut down and asyou can see in the video, kindly the only thing left is a sorry looking stump, apitiful reminder of a lost, majestic totem.The underpinning theme of LLAWN is the presence of absencewith the addition this year of the tag line Revist / Reveal. Therefore myintention is to Revisit the site , Resurrect the tree Œæand Reveal itstemporary replacement during LLAWN03.I want its construction to be a participatory action /contribution therefore we would hold a scrap wood amnesty and encourage peoplefrom Llandudno and further afield to search their sheds for discardedŒæneglected or forgotten about bits of wood. These could be the handle of alost hammer, a table leg, a piece of drift wood, a broken broom or left overpieces from domestic DIY job. Basically a resurrection tree made from recycledmaterials; its size will depend on the donated stockpile. To ensure that thetree is indeed a beautiful thing (and of course safe) I'm going to commissionthe sculptor Alan Goulbourne to build it in collaboration with the community.Alan'sŒæsculptural works utilise sawn wood with which he constructs boldand often physically overwhelming structures. Both representational andabstract, his works are influenced by science and nature and the relationshipbetween them. He often employs a process of order and chaos, starting from asingle gesture or mark, rising to a äóÖcrescendoäó» of marks and movements thatcollectively embody simplicity and complexity, as might a pattern innature.Œæ Therefore a reimagined and reconfigured tree is the perfectsubject for Alan.Once built it will once again become the focal point of thefestival and indeed the town. Many events will take place around it, includingstory telling sessions , dance performances by Family Dance Project and a newcommission calledŒæDROS DROŒæfor a dance artist to collaborate with thecommunityŒæ.TheartistŒæwill work with a group of sons and their fathers to construct aportable Œæstructure ( made from further scraps of wood) that is erected atseveral locations around town where the they will perform a choreographicaction in and around the makeshift den , the last site will be adjacent to ournewly Re-formed tree, TOTEM."

466," Vogliamo realizzare una grande mostra, che partendo dalläó»Italia possa essere presentata anche in altri Paesi. La mostra saríæ composta da 40 abiti fatti di cibo, progettati dai maggiori artisti internazionali. Gli artisti, i progettisti e i designer selezionati provengono da ogni parte del mondo e tutti hanno un'esperienza specifica nel rapporto con il vegetale, vero protagonista di questa imprevedibile mostra.Tra gli altri, saranno presenti abiti di Andrea Branzi, Alessandro Mendini, Guda Koster, Diana Kovacheva, Samantha Murray, Antony Trinidad, Alexandra Sorto e James Ostrer.La mostra saríæ articolata in 3 ambiti.Primo ambito: äóìLa stanza delle performanceäóDurante läó»inaugurazione, il pubblico (solo su invito e saranno invitati tutti coloro che avranno contribuito alla raccolta fondi) verríæ coinvolto in una vera e propria performance, durante la quali gli attori vestiti con abiti realizzati con cibi freschi daranno vita ad alcune rappresentazioni, relazionandosi con gli oggetti, con i suoni del paesaggio casalingo. Saríæ una sorpresa tutta da vivere insieme.Secondo ambito äóìLe performance in un video / Il cibo e la musicaäóPer ovvie ragioni di deterioramento delle materie utilizzate, gli abiti indossati durante la performance inaugurale della mostra non saranno disponibili nei giorni seguenti. Saríæ perí_ possibile prenderne visione attraverso una installazione video. Sulle 4 pareti di una stanza ci saranno 4 schermi a grandezza naturale, sui quali verranno riprodotti gli abiti presentati nelläó»inaugurazione. Läó»esposizione verríæ arricchita dalläó»installazione dei suoni della äóìVegetable Orchestraäó.Terzo ambito äóìCibo VestitivoäóQui ci saranno 40 manichini, realizzati appositamente per la mostra, che celebrano il connubio tra cibo, culture, techne e läó»essere umano. I manichini indossano abiti con vegetali inusuali: alghe, muschi, foglie, frutti etc., tutti realizzati con materiali non deteriorabili.I fondi di cui siamo in cerca ci serviranno per realizzare gli abiti, le performance, i video del secondo ambito e per stampare il catalogo della mostraI presupposti teorici della mostraDenaro per comprare cibo. Guerre per conquistare terre da coltivare. Da sempre sono questi gli strumenti con cui läó»uomo ha soddisfatto il gesto primordiale di cibarsi.Oggi si cerca di combattere läó»enorme problema della fame nel mondo attraverso la ricerca di un cibo dallo standard geografico e qualitativo sempre pií_ omogeneo, un genere di alimentazione äóìindustriale e di massaäó: una auspicata tendenza che avríæ perí_ un risvolto negativo: faríæ perdere la tensione culturale verso il cibo.Mobili, oggetti e cibi saranno sempre pií_ anonimi e funzionali, sempre meno comunicativi e rituali: per läó»uomo comune il cibo sta diventando pop. Sino a diventare app.Unäó»immagine tempo fa mi ha colpito. Per la mia mostra äóìDressing ourselvesäó, Andrea Branzi aveva progettato un abito di feltro, su cui era seminata delläó»erba: regolarmente annaffiata e curata, una volta cresciuta si poteva tagliare. E quindi anche mangiare.Läó»immagine della mostra äóìCibo vestitivoäó íÂ quella di un abito-cibo che si porta con sí©.Il che significa che se si cambia abito si puí_ cambiare cibo. Il che significa che si possono scoprire, trovare, inventare tanti diversi abiti-cibo per una sopravvivenza globale, per una ritualitíæ singolare ma condivisa. Forse esistono archetipi di tutto cií_ in culture primitive. Forse la nostra capacitíæ progettuale ne puí_ inventare di diversi, pií_ semplici o pií_ complessi. La ricerca íÂ partita da qui. Il punto däó»arrivo íÂ il progetto di un futuro in cui abiti-orto avvolgono la persona con un cibo quasi infinito, un cibo ricco di ogni ben di Dio. Abiti che diventano strumenti per una agricoltura diversa, in cui il rito convive con il bisogno, in cui il cibo riacquista il suo valore di nutrimento e di speranza. Due passi precedenti: oltre alla mostra äóìDressing ourselvesäó, in cui designer e artisti erano chiamati a progettare un abito che li definisse, recentemente íÂ stata realizzata la mostra äóìAbiti da Lavoroäó, che si íÂ svolta in Triennale, a Milano, dal giugno a settembre 2014. Líå il tema íÂ stato quello di indagare äóñ attraverso abiti progettati da artisti internazionali äóñ una diversa dimensione delläó»abito da lavoro, che potesse diventare la via per inventare nuovi lavori fantastici."
467," I recently came to the conclusion that it is ok for me to identify as an artist, but then I realized that the only art I have done revolves around theatre, and I wanna explore my artistic abilities in a medium that allows me to push myself creatively, and make a statement about something I care a lot about. 14 Brave women have agreed to share their stories with me about living with depression. When I was first diagnosed with depression, I was scared of its ability to be such a powerful label. I often asked myself, äóìIs this what defines me now?äó And no, it isnäó»t. And that is mainly because I feel like very few people actually KNOW me. We have to be so careful about who we choose to let in, and that is so completely exhausting. What if they let us down? Wouldnäó»t it be so much easier if we could just openly and candidly speak about our demons in a way that doesnäó»t cast a shadow on who we are?ŒæHere is the gist of what I want to do:I want to create an äóìexhibitäó titled, I Am Woman, Hear me Cry. Over the next couple of months, I want to sit down with each of my participants and spend some time with them. I will conduct a casual interview with them that includes the same questions, but I may throw in some extra questions when we are together and I want to know more about something in particular.During our time together, I will give them a disposable camera that they will take around with them. Iäó»ll ask them to capture things that strike them in some way. Things that make them happy, sadäó_ whatever. I wanna see the world through their eyes.ŒæI will also ask them to make a playlist of songs that are important to them.ŒæLastly, I will ask them to write a letter to someone that you would never send to them.ŒæŒæAll of these things will be combined to make a multimedia äóìshrineäó to their existence, struggle, and spirit. The shrine will be designed based on the vibes I get on the beautiful aspects of who they are. They will each feature personalized decorations that I find/create. At the äóìshrineäó will be 2 walkmans, one with a CD of their playlist, one with a CD of their interview that will be available for people to come in and listen to/experience. I just want people to kinda wander and get to know them. Also at your äóìshrineäó will be the photos from the cameras and the letter (if you so choose).After I have collected all of my material, I will begin building an installation that will transform an acting studio on Western Washington University's campus into how I see the feminine heart with depression. The room will include the use of various materials, projections, and lighting effects.ŒæHere are the things I need your help with funding!Œæ-14 disposable cameras and their developmentŒæ- 28 portable CD Players (This will be a challenge. Let me know if you have Œæ Œæsome old ones you would like to donate!)- Building materials- fabrics, paint, canvases... miscellaneous art materials.Œæ"
468," ŒæEnvironmental disasters are occurring around the world with increasing regularity and severity, and they are affecting larger portions of our Earth and devastating ever-greater segments of the population. Disasters are becoming a more frightening reality no matter where we live. Most of us watch televised images of these disasters, separated from their wrath by the relative safety of distance, as if we are watching a movie and not a real event.ŒæA previous work of mine, äóìWar: Ongoing Project,äó stirred viewers and brought them to a new realization of the costs of war. This environment  project will alert them to the emotional costs for humans as a result of global warming and climate changes.This project aims to immerse viewers into the aftermath of a natural disaster, allowing them to experience the personal trauma and loss so many suffer.ŒæThe äóìENVIRONMENT/MAZEäó, created with Hugh Levick, will consist of several large areas, each with a distinctive environmental disaster-related theme. Maze passages will connect each area, but false leads, police barriers; artistic structures and a variety of storm debris will present obstacles to the participants. The idea is to disorient the viewer, causing confusion and frustration similar to what would be felt in a real disaster where one would not find clear paths to relief or safety.The themes of each area will vary, representing fire, storm, flood, wind, rain, etc. Within these areas will be constructed sculptural debris, abstract figures of distressed people or animal bodies, sometimes hung from the ceiling. Fans may be used to generate winds, and mirrors may be installed to create illusions of space and to further the sense of disorientation. The viewer will be exposed to these elements from all angles, increasing the sense of complete immersion into the experience. A very loud and intense sound will emanate from one area. This sound, a combination of music and the actual cries of distressed people, will be an audio theme throughout the exhibit.ŒæŒæIn another area, overhead projectors will cover the floor with an image of rippling water. Against one wall there will be an oversized, blackened canopy bed in ruins. It will be covered with debris, the moldy canopy intertwining with lathe and plaster. Over the bed and cascading, like a waterfall or broken levy, from the wall to the floor will be a flow of crumpled paper. As it seeps from the wall, it is mostly white, but as it falls down over the bed, it gradually turns from white to black. Projected images reflected on that cascade will create the impression of falling water. A room that was once someoneäó»s sanctuary of sleep and comfort has been destroyed. The sound in this room is that of a beating heart.ŒæŒæThese rooms and passages will be generally dark enough to cause the viewer some anxiety or disorientation but with just enough light for safe navigation.  I welcome other participating artists and set designers to design and build some of the areas. They will be recognized as creative participants in the project. Companies will be encouraged to participate through donations of money and materials. Grants from the state or local government could help fund this project.ŒæŒæInstallations of this project are being planned for Buffalo, NY, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and California. I hope to bring this traveling exhibit to as many locations around the world as will welcome it.ŒæŒæRewardsThe reward for supporting this project will be a signed original piece of art from the collection of Ben Perrone. The art reward will take into account the amount donated. Also the names of major donors will be inscribed on the walls of the project.Œæ"
469," We're the only company in the world that makes high-resolution photographic sequin mosaics by hand. We put a modern spin on a vintage technology, bringing imagery to life in a whole new way. Our mosaics look like illuminated LEDs, but are actually just reflecting light - making images glitter and shine without any electricity.All of our mosaics are 100% handmade in Los Angeles, which as you can see in the video, is a significant undertaking (FYI, it takes 4 hours to produce one square foot of sequin mosaic!) So we're looking to automate the process, to cut down on production time and make our art more accessible. And for the very first time, we're making our creations available to folks everywhere. Our new production system is designed and ready to go; all we need is the capital to purchase the new machinery. Production will remain 100% in Los Angeles and you, dear backer, will be helping build the foundation for a developing cottage industry right here in your home country. You're probably thinking, ""Oh they've already got some big clients, they don't need help."" Well, the truth is, time is our biggest overhead. We're barely breaking even because production is so costly. We need to invest in a hydraulic press, custom tooling, dies and new molds. Other costs involved include paying engineers for design and development of our new system. Your contribution would help make these a reality!"
470," Cool&Tot,Œæthe Berlin art-production collective, is taking part in this yearäó»s Berlin 48 Stunden Neukí_lln Festival (June 26th - 28th, 2015) with project Salvation-Island-Art. Project Salvation-Island-Art is made possible through Neukí_lln's Cultural development budget.  With your additional support of 1000 Euros our float/island will be further designed and staged (focus on LED lights and basic acoustics) so as to enhance the idea of salvation that art seeks to offer. For the Festival, our float/island will be mounted at Berlin's Hermann Platz. ŒæThe real goal is to later get it on water. ŒæBerlin has an enormous, for the most part not very used, waterway network.

ŒæAmong the topics, it is looking at the co-existence of Muslims and Christians in Berlinäó»s  year 2029 Neukí_lln neighbourhood.What does the project consist of?Salvation-Island-Art  is technically  a float/installation composed of three different parts. Themain float is a hard geometrical hexagon base with an inflatable ring-shaped gallery made of  recycled plastic. The ring will be lit from the inside in order to create a bright äóÖspace station-effectäó» able to dramatize the idea of salvation for art and through art. ŒæOur float/island is being built exactly as if it was going straight to water. ŒæAt HermannPlatz, we look to stimulating the theatrical effect as if being on water.

The focus is sometimes on presenting art dealing with current social issues.  Since the festival was established in 1999, 48 Stunden Neukí_lln has become the largest festival of contemporary arts in Berlin.  The Festival aims every year to incorporate all participating projects as an integral part of Berlinäó»s Neukí_lln neighbourhood and open it up to visitation from locals and numerous visitors alike.ŒæWhat is the theme of this yearäó»s Festival?This year the Festival will delve into the theme of ""S.O.S. äóñ Can Art save the World?""  In co-operation with both Berlin-based and international artists, the Festival will focus on the question of what the role of art in society today really is as well as dealing with the expectations and challenges that society confronts the artists with.  In this stimulating context, project  Salvation-Island-Art  will be presented to an ever-growingaudience from Germany and the world alike.  Last year during the Festival weekend around60,000 thousand people visited northern Neukí_lln experiencing new art creationsfirst hand."

This phenomenon of heavy precipitation remained extraordinary there are still 100 years should become more frequent because of the current climate change. Therefore to address this theme of Nuit Blanche, I chose to develop the subject of the Flood.La thí©matique de cette nouvelle session de la Nuit Blanche est le climat faisant í©cho íæ la COP 21 qui aura lieu íæ Paris fin 2015.Depuis quelques anní©es de nombreux phí©nomíÂnes naturelles extríÈmes ont eu lieu dans le monde avec une frí©quence qui säó»accí©líÂre. Läó»histoire de Paris a connu aussi des í©ví©nements mí©tí©orologiques remarquables et notamment en 1910 avec une crue exceptionnelle qui a inondí© une grande partie de la ville et paralysí© les transports en communs. Ce phí©nomíÂne de forte prí©cipitation qui restait extraordinaire il y a encore 100 ans devrait devenir plus frí©quents íæ cause de ces changements climatiques actuels. Cäó»est pourquoi pour rí©pondre íæ ce thíÂme de la Nuit Blanche, jäó»ai choisi de dí©velopper le sujet du Dí©luge / Flood.Deluge myths are the most numerous, and almost universally known. Obviously, this end of the world is not represented as radical, but as the end of humanity, followed by the appearance of a new humanity. In many myths, the Flood is attached to a fault that caused the anger of the Supreme Being. But if we examine the myths that announce the impending Flood, we find, among the major causes, not only the sins of men, but also the decay of the world. We can say then that the Flood opened the way to both a re-creation of the world and a regeneration of humanity.Climate change is also an opportunity for everyone to change their lifestyle and become more aware of the fragility of our planet.Flood echoed these universal stories and history of Paris. Feel, feel, what will be the world without awareness of man is the challenge of Flood. The audience wanders, observes, weaves through these filaments slowly trickles or a viscous liquid, which seems to take its time like the present climate changes. Flood surprised by this black and challenges here symbol of the extreme degradation of the natural elements. An uneasy feeling settled. Flood we asked about our future. And if the seas and rains become so?Les mythes du Dí©luge sont les plus nombreux, et presque universellement connus. íŠvidemment, cette fin du monde näó»est pas reprí©sentí©e comme radicale,mais plutíÇt comme la fin däó»une humanití©, suivie de läó»apparition däó»une humanití© nouvelle. Dans un grand nombre de mythes, le Dí©luge est rattachí© íæ une faute qui a provoquí© la colíÂre de läó»í_tre supríÈme. Mais, si läó»on examine les mythes qui annoncent läó»imminence du Dí©luge, on retrouve, parmi les causes principales, non seulement les pí©chí©s des hommes, mais aussi la dí©crí©pitude du monde. On peut dire alors que le Dí©luge a ouvert la voie íæ la fois íæ une re-crí©ation du monde et íæ une rí©gí©ní©ration de läó»humanití©.Les changements climatiques sont aussi une occasion pour chacun de modifier son mode de vie et prendre davantage conscience de la fragilití© de notre planíÂte.Flood fait í©cho íæ ces rí©cits universels et íæ läó»histoire de Paris. Ressentir, sentir, ce que sera la planíÂte sans prise de conscience de läó»homme tel est läó»enjeu de Flood. Le public se balade, observe, se faufile íæ travers ces filaments ou ruisselle lentement un liquide visqueux, qui semble prendre son temps íæ läó»image des í©volutions climatiques actuels. Flood í©tonne et interpelle par ce noir, ici symbole de la dí©gradation extríÈme des í©lí©ments naturels. Un sentiment de malaise säó»installe. Flood nous interroge sur notre avenir. Et si les mers et les pluies devenaient ainsi ?COMPOSITIONThe installation is formed of two superimposed structures, one on the ceiling and the other to the ground. These two structures are connected by wires in black pvc sections. On the ground, a wooden container 5 meters by 10 meters on which are attached metal hooks hosts a black liquid (oil or black paint) to the device hidden. For sealing, a black membrane is disposed on the container wall. On the ceiling, a suspended metallic grating hang the black fi ls. The project takes place in an interior space afi n to suspend the device. A drip system is installed on the tallest structure supplying each of the filamentsL'installation est formí©e de 2 structures superposí©es, l'une au plafond et läó»autre au sol. Ces 2 structures sont relií©es par des fi ls en pvc noir de diffí©rentes sections. Au sol, un rí©cipient en bois de 5 míÂtres par 10 míÂtres sur lequel sont fi xí©s des crochets mí©talliques accueille un liquide noir (huile ou peinture noire) permettant de cachí©s le dispositif. Pour assurer läó»í©tanchí©ití© , une membrane noire est disposí©e sur les paroi du rí©cipient. Au plafond, un caillebottis mí©tallique suspendu sont accrochí©s les fi ls noirs.

473," Urban HistoriesŒæThe project is a collaboration between Studio Aki and Appro-pri8 Theatre, inspired by a renovation which Studio Aki are currently undertaking in Stoke Newington. Ultimately we envisage this a site specific project based within a house. This first incarnation will be an installation which collages together several houses and will be based at Rara Studios.The InstallationIn the process of renovating a house, as walls are stripped back, old coverings removed, holes knocked through stud and brick walls,  the layers uncovered hint at a houseäó»s past; a fragment of 1970äó»s wallpaper, a victorian tile. These are clues give rise to the question, what lives have existed within these walls? Urban Histories seeks to explore these musings through series of vignettes.Visitors will be invited into the 'House' to meet past occupants and witness fragments of their lives. Urban Histories will be a work in progress in June and will feature rehearsed readings of our script in development.Why a Kickstarter?We are asking you to help us make this first stage of our project really great by helping us raise final funds or by sending an object from your home, which you may be about to get rid of.

476," Beloved Disciple: An exploration in unexplored (or controversial) themes; to confront, to expound, to proffer and to create a renewed understanding of faith.Friday 31st of July, 2015. LOT 23, Eden Terrace, Auckland, NZI am finally putting on a show/exhibit/installation/event, and I am needing your help to see it come to fruition. The venue has been booked and the date set. I am over the moon excited and cannot wait to have this finally happen. This project has been a few years in the making for me. It deals with the many dilemmas I faced growing up in a religious household, knowing (though not necessarily accepting) who I was... and then coming to terms with this whilst redefining my personal faith.The Beloved DiscipleŒæis a visual (fine arts painting, installation, and live performance art) exploration of the controversial theme of sexuality and Christianity. Controversial in the sense that I offer a suggestion, one that is shocking, but ultimately enriching. It begs the questions ""What if?"" and ""Would it have changed much?"" and also ""How different would the world be if...?"" The questions you are confronted with are yours to deal with, and only you can rationalize, process and conclude your own response; the dialogue whether spoken or internalized serves to create a deeper understanding for yourself and why you choose to believe what you do.I am not challenging faith... merely suggesting that we question what it is we believe so that we understand how we came to know it.What I need the money for:There are a few costs involved in the producing of this event/exhibition. Firstly, costs and fees for the hiring of the gallery space and opening night Drinks and nibbles. This alone comes to about $1200.00 NZD ($600 gallery hiring fee and $600 opening night costs and Printed PR &Advertising)ŒæFurthermore, there are the costs for the framing, freighting, assemblage and hanging of the works. Luckily there aren't too many works to be hung so the cost for manpower comes to about $440 NZD.I will need a final $1000 NZD to acquire the last and final touches for some of the installation artworks themselves.The rest of the costs will be used to pay for the Kickstarter fees and professional scanning and limited print reproductions of the works."
477," We believe that the design of the devices we use every day have to be rethought.ŒæFor example you know that smartphones contain ""rare earth"" minerals and precious and rare?To date, these minerals are nearly impossible to recycle because of the design of the device which makes it almost impossible or restricted the recycling process.Our project, if you will support, is to create a temporary exhibition in several Italian cities, with the aim of making people aware of a problem like this.ŒæEveryone uses one or more mobile phones in Italy or computers or other technological devices but they are very few who really know the end of their life cycle of these products.Our project includes:"
478," Firstly the image is not the design, but rather the inspirationAfter seeing the famous forest chandelier, see here (as pictured)sadly there is only 100 in the world and each costs $4,100and then the DIY which got so close, but not quite.. see hereSame principle here but just a pattern, not a scene.. see hereI have wanted to create a few designs of my own, however at the moment i'm a struggling studying student with three kids and can't afford most of the parts i'd need to make one as a sculpture, One single fake branch was $8 AUD.I was just playing around with some ideas but even thats cost $20 in rope, glue, and fake branches. My next thought is as i'm learning to be a 3d graphic artist I could just design one not only that but just get them 3d printed.So what exactly does the money do?Well In order to make and test said lamp/lighting cover designs, I'll need a 3D Printer and it also insures that I can ship any design to the highest backers.If I get to $8000I'll design and test several sculptures and shadow producing lamps, in various types, rose garden, thorns, forest (different to theirs), posting DIY instructions with pictures better than my iphone which is the current image (sorry)This will be available as a download to everyone for a few dollars and free to those that have sponsored more than $50If I get more..

481," Why Kickstarter?I'm hereŒæto raise funds tohelp stage an art exhibition on the theme of love and loss.ŒæMuch of the work is alreadyŒæcompleted but I desperately need financial support to assistin the professional framing of work, the production of the exhibition catalogueand of course, the production of rewards to send to my generous supporters!What is Love and Loss?The exhibition äóÖLove and Lossäó», will aimto examine those connections within our lives that have helped to shape our understandingof love. Exploring the complex emotions arising from my past experiences, Iwant to create an art exhibition that articulates the power of passion, thedestructive influence of control and the shared intimacy of tenderness. To dothis, I will use artefacts, images and artworks taken from former friendships,relationships and family connections to act as totemic testaments to firstlove,Œæcontrolled love and unconditional love. How will Love and LossŒærelate toŒæthe viewer?Throughout the Love and Lossexhibition, the viewer will be invited to evaluate artworks such as; fragmentsof destroyed paintings, items of clothing and delicate ephemeral portraits toconsider events around love and loss in their own lives and to understand themas shared elements of the human condition. It is hoped that those visiting the show will gain a sense ofŒæwhatŒæit is to experience love and loss.Where didthe idea for love and loss come from?The ideafor Love and Loss came about recently as a result of losing my mum to cancer.When trying to understand and handle the range of complex emotions that camewith losing a loved one, I realised that throughout my life, I have had many friendshipsand relationships where I have loved and lost people that have been very dear tome, not necessarily in death, but sometimes as a result of moving away orsimply moving on. When this has happened, I have kept mementoes and artefactsto remind me of the time they were in my life. These are the objects andartworks that form the content of Love and Loss. Why showLove and Loss in Redcar?Redcar isa seaside town in the North East of England where I grew up as a small child. Iremember fishing off the South Gare with mum as a child and her always makingsureŒæwe bothŒæthrew our catches back in to the sea so they could live for anotherday. It made sense to launch Love and Loss in a town with such fond memories.The gallery, Palace Arts, is also a superb venue for this show. . Your generosity and support willhelp to make this happen. "

I go to toy shows and wish that these shows could be accessed or attended everyday or at least every weekend. I have spent the last 15 years of my life collecting and building my G1 Transformer collection for the world. My collection is special for it only has the TFs that were present and sold in the US during 1984 - 1988. My collection will also display doubles of every TF from the era, so the viewer can be taking back in time to when they looked at the catalog pamphlet as a kid. Now TFs wont be the only toys on exhibit in the museum. We will have G.I Joe. Voltron, Robotech, Jem, Masters of the Universe and Gobots. These will be on display in a separate exhibit all together.ŒæThe bazaar will be an area where vendors and traders can set up booths and sale there toys and gifts.  This will be for certain times of the day for each day may have a different vendor. Now what makes this museum unique is that one can actually order the exhibits. Every exhibit will have a pouch of tags in front. The tag will state IN STOCK, PREORDER, BACKORDER or OUT OF STOCK. The viewer then will take this to the Toy/Gift shop and the toy clerk will then find that toy or set an order for you so you can come pick it up or we can have it mailed to you as well. Now if a toy is OUT OF STOCK and the viewer must have it. A 30% finders fee will be attached to the purchase fee for finding the item for you. The displays will also be well lit and protected behind flexi glass like a work of art as well as a piece of history. They will also have detail info about every TF that is on display such as origin, allegiance, stats, powers, personality traits, rivals as well as original origin such as Diaclone or Microman.There will also be a food court where one can eat and quench ones thirst. We also serve Beer/Wine with hot grilled food from the bar as well as an old school retro arcade with classic arcades from the 80s, 90s and 2000s. Also the atmosphere and music is from those decades as well to give you that retro feel."

486," A cross-pollination of art, music and science -- this model project will heighten awareness about the plight of the honeybees in our community and globally.My concern for the plight of honeybees has inspired me to dream up an artistic process that would create awareness about the importance of bees and bee pollination. The bee species is crucial for the environment because of the role it plays in pollinating a third of the plants in the United States and over fifty different crops, resulting in the reproduction of offspring that are genetically diverse. Through collaboration with environmental scientists, artists and musicians, I would like to create a model for and conduct honeybee educational workshops featuring the process and creation of three large bee sculptures to be installed in key locations in San Diego.  The research and workshops would culminate with a grand finale performance as a statement of bee awareness and consciousness.ŒæThis kickstarter will help with all of the different cost of the project from booking the venue to the materials that the artist will need to compete these bee sculptures all around San Diego.

487," When you look at the bottom of a plastic container before recycling it, do you ever wonder who created that ubiquitous system of triangles and numbers?  Milly Zantow, a little known woman from south central Wisconsin had a vision, set out to make a difference in the world, and did.Although many have never even heard of her, she is one of the most important people in the recycling community.  Milly is responsible for creating that system of numbered triangle symbols on the bottom of plastic containers. Raised to reuse and recycle, Milly was always sensitive to waste.  Back in the 1970s she was surprised to hear that a rural Sauk County, Wisconsin garbage dump was to be closed early because it was filling up so fast.  Milly went to the dump and sat and watched as people dropped off their garbage. One thing she noted was that a majority of what she saw was made of plastic.  She believed that something had to be done.  She contacted a local milk jug manufacturer and came to an exciting conclusion äóñ that the plastic could be ground down and reused. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Zantow pushed to introduce plastics recycling to the area.  After laying groundwork with lawmakers, communities and industry, in 1979, Zantow co-founded the first complete recycling service in Sauk County, E-Z Recycling, which handled more than 200,000 pounds of materials in its first full year."" Milly died in 2014 at the age of 91.  She never saw a monument in her name, but a group of Sauk County Institute of Leadership program participants wish to raise funds to place at least one memorial for this inspirational woman who did so much with so little.  Our goal is to place a personalized bench with a custom-made art piece in the newly constructed Harvest Park located in Reedsburg, Wisconsin.  The art piece is to be made of recycled metal materials; the bench will be made of recycled plastic and feature a memorial in Milly's honor.  We would also like to place an informational sign describing her contribution to the world of recycling.  We have contacted a local bench company that will assist in providing the bench and have been in discussions with local artists that will create a one-of-a-kind sign befitting such an icon. Harvest Park, in Reedsburg, Wisconsin is the home of The Ruminant, a must see as a part of the countyäó»s up and coming Fermentation Fest.  Having a memorial for Milly in a place where a combine was recycled into a beautiful art piece feels right.  Follow the link below to learn more about The Ruminant:http://www.karlunnasch.com/project-pages/2013.10-ruminant-stained-glass-harvesting-combine.htm Harvest Park is a highlight of the yearly Fermentation Fest and will be seen by thousands of people: http://fermentationfest.com/Related Linkswww.facebook.com/MillyZantowhttp://millyzantow.blogspot.com/ "

489," The photo above is from Camp Suburbia last year on playa. This is a special camp to those both on and off the playa, and we are planning on returning for the 2015 burn. We have dreams of expanding across the board, and have some extra costs that go with that expansion. Every member of our camp contributes a great deal of their time and money, but our camp still needs some additional assistance. We hope that the community will step up and help us make our dream a reality!ŒæBelow I have posted the majority of our camp application for anyone to read, and I hope it paints a decent image of our goals. We were able to recycle almost everything we used from last year, and will obtain items as cost efficient as possible for this year. The money we raise here will go directly into the cost of building the homes (roughly $400 a house depending on current wood cost), and getting us started on building our participant playground. Please ask away with any questions you have!Physically describe Camp Suburbia?Our camp will resemble a typical cul-de-sac you might find in any suburban town. This is where our non-camp participants will spend their time enjoying our camp and our gifts.We hope to get placed on esplanade, and are planning on building a 'playgound & park' on the inner playa across the street from our entrance. This playground will include features such as; a swing set, a slide, monkey bars, a fort (or something else to climb on), a slackline (hopefully), and an arial setup. We also plan to lay some fake grass around with what looks like a sidewalk running through it (as in a pathway you'd find in any park in the suburbs) and benches placed around the sidewalk. We've also begun looking into setting up a few disc golf baskets. Lights will be placed in order to illuminate all of the equipment to allow for use at any time.Once you enter our actual 'camp space' you will find 8 houses with attached garages (houses will measure 8x8x10 and garages will measure 8x4x6). As you walk further into our camp space, you'll find yourself walking down the center of a cul-de-sac and quickly surrounded by houses. The homes have working front doors, windows, outside lights, mailboxes, also fake grass lawns, white picket fences, and sidewalks. The homes & garages will be painted in typical suburban fashion, as well as welcome mats, house numbers, fake flowers, doorbells, and anything else we get our hands on! The garages are open on the front (to appear like the garage door is open), and will have typical garage items (such as; camping equipment, tools, a ladder, old paint supplies, skis, random boxes that say 'christmas decorations' and stuff on them, bicycles, lawn chairs, and once again anything else we get our hands on). The street will have lamps and spot lights (to light the neighborhood up at night). All of the lights we currently have for the homes & street lamps run off of solar power (we don't have or want cables to bury). At the back end of the cul-de-sac we will have our country club. This building will measure approx. 26x30x10, with working french doors in the middle and working windows on both sides. Just like the houses, the country club will be painted and made to replicate an actual country club as best we can. We plan to line the inside with rugs and have a few chairs/couches to hang out on. In front of the country club we will have a few bike parking spots with lines and signs that say 'visitor parking only'.What is Camp Suburbia bringing in terms of interactivity to the playa this year?24 hours a day participants will be able to enjoy our cul-de-sac of homes. It will have 8 homes with attached garages (the homes are 8x8x10 and the garages are 8x4x6), each with green grass lawns, white picket fences, sidewalks, and street lamps. In several of the lawns we will have different types of games available for participants (games such as croquette, badminton, frisbee, kite flying, bocce ball, cornhole, and anything else we get our hands on!). Several of the homes will have a streetlamp in front along with spotlights so the lawn will remain lit at night, allowing participants to enjoy the games at any time.Across the street (on the inner playa) we plan to construct a fully functional playground along with fake grass, park benches, and street lamps. This playground will include features such as; a swing set, a slide, monkey bars, basketball hoops, a fort (or something else to climb on), a slackline (hopefully), and an arial setup. We've also begun looking into setting up a few disc golf baskets. Lights will be placed in order to illuminate all of the equipment to allow for use at any time.We will also have a Country Club (approx. 26x30x10) with which we will host our events and parties. We plan to stock the club with ample 'white collar' dress wear to pass out to participants and annoyingly enforce a strict dress code policy. Having this club house will allow us to open the doors at any time (which we plan to do frequently) invite in participants, and have a good time. This could range from a wine tasting to a round of imagi-golf (this is where you dress like a golfer, carry around clubs, and pretend to hit golf balls... however we use no balls, we just walk around bragging about how good our shots are and mostly drinking).What events does Camp Suburbia plan to host this year on playa?During the week we will host four main events each lasting multiple hours at a minimum. All ages are welcome and encouraged to attend. The first event will begin Sunday night when we host a 'welcome home wine down' where we will open up the country club for the first time, have the bar fully stocked with wine (both red & white), and showcase some local dj's. The neighborhood will be lit up to enjoy the games, and this will give us the first chance to welcome everyone back home with class. Don't forget this is a Country Club, formal wear required (and provided for some).Our second event will be held on Tuesday morning when we host our second annual yard sale. We will litter the lawns with all sorts of treasures & crap for people to pick through. Last year, and again this year we hope to have items such as; tents, water bottles, flashlights, bike locks, functioning bikes, costumes, platewear, wet wipes, batteries, tampons, dry goods, knick-knacks, toys, art, shoes, and more. We don't want to bring any of these items home with us, so expect the very best in yard sale finds in Suburbia! Everyone will be allowed to take whatever they wish, and our camp will be in our suburban costumes meeting & greeting. We plan to open up the wine bar for this event too!The third event we will host is going to be a block party on Wednesday afternoon. We'll block off the end of our cul-de-sac, get all the lawn games ready for action, and roll out the grills. We plan to cook up a bunch of burgers & brats and serve fresh lemonade (vodka optional & encouraged). What better way to spend the middle of your day than relaxing on the lawn eating a fresh brat and enjoying a cold lemonade. We'll have some music bumping in the country club, and hopefully get everyone back into their afternoon formal wear again!The fourth and final of our scheduled events will take place on Thursday late afternoon. Here we will gather up and head off for a round of imagi-golf to the Man and back. Golfing attire, clubs, and drinks are provided. After a lovely stroll around the city, we'll meet back up at the country club for celebratory drinks and stories of our adventures!On our non-event scheduled days (Monday, Friday & Saturday) we will open up the wine bar and challenge passing by participants to friendly competitions of bocce ball, disc golf, and croquette. No matter day or night, there will always be something fun for everyone to entertain themselves with at Camp Suburbia!Here's our camp photo from last year!Thanks for taking the time to read through this. You can find our camp facebook page at www.facebook.com/CampSuburbia to check out more photos!"
490," I'm fascinated by the world and everything that it has to offer. From beautiful fields to barren deserts, tropical forests to arctic tundra, huge cities to small villages in areas of the world most never go. You always see camera crews following around one person as they travel to some secluded locations but what about the places nobody dares to tread and the harsh and treacherous roads and landscapes they have to cross over to get there that you don't see? I want to record the world, all of it. From the the most breathtaking of sights to some of the smaller not as captivating areas and the roads in between. Talk to local people and see what they have to say about their own little slice of life. Take in everything that this planet has to offer and record everything in first person so everyone can get a feel for what it's like to be there staring at vast canyons, traversing the rough terrain of the forests and even talking to the people in these areas. My goal is to make you feel like you've been there. Not to have just seen the area but to have traveled there, trekked over the terrain surrounding the area, talked to the locals, scaled rock faces, swam across bodies of water and everything in between to get to secluded locations the world wants to see. It's a beautiful world out there, don't be afraid of what it's hiding because it might be something magnificent and you'll never know unless you're willing to jump."
491," For eight years, The House of Art has moved from space to space, filling each one with fantastical art, including dramatic and photo realistic pencil drawings, and paper mache creatures in the form of dragons, beasts, and even a full-size African elephant.ŒæPaintings and sculptures breathe life into empty spaces; so much so, that the many mannequins seem to move on their own. Nowhere else in the world can you see its equal. It has attracted attention from all over the nation, and has been featured in documentaries in at least two other countries. Once it nearly spawned a television program when it became one of the top attractions in the State of West Virginia. Just when it seemed that things could only get better, in 2013 the House of Art had to suddenly shut its doors and journey forward once again to find a home for its Appalachian artists and their creations. A year passed, and it seemed like nothing was going to happen.Then a generous donation was made. A private investor has given us the opportunity to fix this building up and three years to return the investment. The property at 900 Mercer St. is nearly 100 years old and was, for many years, the old Virginia Bank of Commerce. Other than a drably painted vault door, there was little to be seen in this now deadened place, but quickly The House of Art began restoring the building back to its former glory. In no time Œæcarpets were pulled up, revealing the original tile floors. Walls were torn down, along with drop ceilings and useless mechanical equipment, revealing a three bay coffered ceiling that was nearly two feet thick and filled with dental molding. After only a month, the original historic qualities of the building began to shine through.ŒæProgressŒæThis place will be the first structure that the gallery can solely call its own, and with your help we can bring it up to the standards of wonder and spectacle that the House of Art is known for. We just need help taking care of the basics, like electrical, heating, cooling, and additional bathrooms, as well as meeting building codes and regulations that will come up during the restoration process.We will also replace the existing windows and storefront with Œæhistorically accurate units, at their original heights, so that the gallery can become even more present in the community. At this point, there are four phases we would like to complete, to help establish the new Gary Bowling's House of Art. ŒæŒæäó¢	Meeting bathroom requirementsäó¢	Accessibility and egress issues äó¢	Mechanical upgrades  / Electrical / Heating and Coolingäó¢ Re-roof main structure and workshop additionäó¢	Getting the main show room open äó¢	Installing access to the workshop äó¢	Refurbishing the vault room äó¢	Installing all new windows on the first level äó¢	Refurbishing the original storefront äó¢	Finishing out the upper floor to create additional gallery / studio space äó¢	Installing new windows on the upper level / additional signage äó¢	Refinish workshop äó¢	Create a secondary exit from the workshop äó¢	Install an additional restroomäó¢	Install new historical window fixtures in existing openings äó¢	Repair and secure coiling door äó¢	This art center in southern West Virginia will brighten the existence of all that come near. äó¢ Exposing children to art and art classes, which some Appalachian communities are totally without in their daily curriculum.  äó¢	Bring art to Veterans as a way of expressing emotion when there are not words. äó¢ Add to a already growing art community in Southern West Virginia. Artistic Legacy By helping re-establishing this art center in Southern West Virginia, you will be facilitating art in the surrounding Appalachian communities, and giving a home for the Appalachian artist and their creations. You will be helping expose young up-and-coming artist to the potential of practicing art as a profession, and showing how a passion to create can become the driving force behind a career.  In doing so, you will help to change the face and mindset of the community for generations. Many thriving artists have had interaction with the House of Art or its artists. Without that experience, their art may have never had a place to grow and be nurtured into what it now is.We have a building. Now we just need your help to make it usable. We would like to raise $40,000.00 as a stepping-stone in our efforts to raise $300,000.00, So that that we can not only fix the building, but create a facility that will inspire generations of Appalachian artists.Gary Bowlingäó»s House of Art is a 501(C)-3 non-profit and all donations are tax-deductible.We're offering a host of rewards and gifts for your pledges. Whether digital, 2D, sculptural, or fantastical, here's your chance to own a small part of Gary Bowlingäó»s House of Art. Gary Bowling Gary Bowling is the president and co-founder of the gallery. His art is his autobiography. It reflects moments of his daily life, fingerprints of his emotions, thoughts, and attitudes at the time of execution. Using a wide range of mediums (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.), he transforms wood, paper, and canvas into transitional reflections.His art is inherently versatile, and depicts progressive-microcosms with universal appeal. With varying degrees of subtlety, Bowling incorporates pundits, philosophy, satire, and humor. Beauty embraces wit and wisdom. With adaptations of materials, techniques and forms, Bowling integrates traditional basics with unique treatments. The unexpected embraces tradition.Bowling has participated in art shows from New York to Miami. His paintings, however, have spanned the globe with their popularity. Private collectors are responsible for his global recognition. His national recognition comes from state and federal governments, as well as private collectors. Examples of his works can be seen in state and federal exhibits, including, but not limited to, the Smithsonian.Jody QueenQueen is a self-taught artist who is ever-focused on the minute detail that makes every subject unique and ultimately brings it to life. his work is startlingly realistic and invites us to examine more closely the meticulous regard for the textures that give everyday objects their singularity. Queen works primarily in layered graphite, enjoying the range of expression the medium allows. he also works in wood, acrylics, and mixed media. Following the dream of sharing his love of art, Queen is the co-founder and vice-president of Gary Bowling's House of Art, ŒæHis work has also been juried into Tamarack, the Best of West Virginia.Jamie PowersPowers is an acrylic painter and a mixed media artist.  The paintings are usually horror-themed, of which some are fiction, while others are based on reality. He was born in the dark hollows of southwest Virginia, the son of a coal miner, and grew up in McDowell County, West Virginia.He graduated Big Creek High School in 1996, then went on to study at the Columbus College of Art and Design, majoring in Illustration. He graduated in the spring of 2001.He has worked as a freelance illustrator, but now focuses more on the fine arts.  He has shown work at The House of Art in Bluefield, WV from 2010-2014, in a group exhibition called äóìThinking Like a Mountainäó at the Southwest Virginia Community College in 2010, and later at Bluefield College in 2012. He Œæalso displayed work at Kulture Klash 7 in Charleston, South Carolina in 2011, and at The East End Artmares exhibitions in Charleston, WV from 2010-2012.  He was just juried into The Allied Artists of West Virginia show at the Huntington museum.Jamie is still creeping around the coalfields of southern WV, being inspired by all the real monsters in the region.Isaac Preston Preston has been with the House of Art crew for roughly six years, and many of his works have been created and displayed at the gallery. He presented an art show with 'The Artful Lawyer' gallery in Blacksburg, VA in 2013, and hisŒæwork is also featured in the Appalachian Arts Center in Wardell, VA and the Riff Raff Arts Collective in Princeton, WV. Preston uses recyclables as his primary medium, and he is also known for his works in wire sculpture. He is also active with the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, and Œæacted with the Planet Extreme Teen Center in Princeton, WV in their production of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' in which he played Willie Wonka. When time allows, he poses as a live model for artists, and performs hand percussion and spoken word at open stage events. He has also conducted workshops for his wire work. Originally centered in Bluefield, WV, PrestonŒæhopes that reestablishing in the Princeton area will give him, and other artists, a great opportunity to share their passion with others. He seeks to inspire Œænew generations to follow their passion and spread happiness whenever possible.Rita MontrosseIs a native to West Virginia and has taught art for 34 years at Princeton Senior High School in Mercer County. Presently, she is an adjunct instructor of Watercolor and Metals Smithing at Concord University.Her paintings reflect a personal relationship with her environment, either at home in the mountains of West Virginia or in her travels. Her many sketches and photographs provide material for her watercolors/mixed media paintings, and have even influenced her jewelry designs. Whichever media she uses, she works in a series starting with a representational theme and pushing it as far as she can in developing the concepts. She doesn't set a limit to the number in a series, instead working it until it seems complete. Often, a series will be revisited because she canäó»t release it, or has had an insight into a new compositional arrangement. She feels fortunate that she lives in the beautiful state of West Virginia and has been able to work at what she loves, both as an art teacher and an artist/artisan. Christopher Lee Clark Clark works in a wide array of mediums, including ink, paint, plaster, and sculpture. He is one of the key artists behind the library mural in Princeton, and has created set pieces for the Hinton, WV theater group Ars Creo, in which he also performs as an actor. Clark is a member of the Appalachian Artists Collective, for which he designed and built the Paper Theater in the Clay Center in Charleston, WV, and his work has been used and published by the internet artist community founded by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, HitRecord. Clark's work captures scenes of intricate fantasy, often encompassing sinister, unusual, or otherworldly tones. The creatures he has created at the House of Art and elsewhere are the fully realized visions of a mind that sees no impossibility in the realms of creation, and works to bring elements of spectacle, wonder, and imagination to life. Many of his pieces are visual staples of Princeton life, appearing in shop windows, parades, and productions. Clark has been part of the House of Art for six years.Gary Bowling, Austin Persinger, Jody Queen, Steve Jessee, Christopher Clark, Ash Gill, Patch Whiskey, Carl Ferguson, Isaac Preston, Maggie Meehan, Rita Montrosse, Jeff Travers, Jamie Powers, Robbie Moore, Debbie Bowling, Michael Abraham, Brian Aliff, Kyle Davis, Richard Shrewsbury, Œæ Brandon Daniels, Tiffany Freed, Jamie Belcher, Jerry Frech, Anthony Harvey, Dana Frech, Erica Hobbs, John Trail, Chris DeHart, Christine Keller, Jill Pritchett, Raymond Neeley, Gaynell Dawson, Don Thomposon, Janis Dean, Courtney Waller, Janice Belcher, C R Ward, Amy McPherson,Trey Snyder, Charkera Erwin, Sam Underwood, Elizabeth Hern, Jeff Smiley, Bonita Sink, Rebecca Neal, Wanda Sperling,Kathy Kennedy, Elizabeth Perdue, ŒæBeth Blankenship, Martha Sabol, LaQuay Swade,"
492," I am a Palestinian-Black Muslim American, living as a transplant in the city of Chicago. This identity has always empowered me. I have always felt as if activism and resistance has run through my veins, and I have always created works of arts on the basis of social justice and my personal identity. I was told, albeit jokingly and with a laugh, by one of my professors this year, that the two most hated people in the world got together and created me. Given the current events of this year, he might not have been too far off the mark with his presumption. This year, it was hard to be Black, it was hard to be Palestinian, it was hard to be a Muslim, it was hard to be a woman, and it was even harder to accept being an American.ŒæI have always been proud of who I am; heritage, faith, culture, nationality, but it seemed everywhere I looked there was an overwhelming persecution of every aspect of my life that I identified with. This resulted in my inability to focus, even at times feeling so mentally blocked I believed I would never be able to create art again. From national current events like the murders of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Tanesha Anderson, Yvette Smith, and more, the indictments, the resulting äóìriotsäó and protests, the serge and flux of gun violence in the city of Chicago, to the United States role in international affairs such as Israeläó»s siege on Gaza, drone strikes in Pakistan, the crises in Syria and the Congo, the recent release of the CIA torture report, my brain was close to malfunction. I had nightmares about the link between the prison and the military industrial complex, what it all really means, and the implications of my role in the problems of the world as a tax paying American.ŒæI quickly found that my emotions towards the state of the world around me were not mimicked within the walls of SAIC as an institution. It was hard for me to find a space where I felt safe and understood when I tried to bring up these issues, issues very relevant to the political and personal narrative driven works I create. It didnäó»t seem as if any of the things that so deeply affected me, were on the radar of the majority of the professors and students that I encountered, I felt there wasnäó»t a space in which I could speak on these tragedies, that I witnessed daily on the news and through social media. Suddenly it became increasingly apparent to me that the reason that these world issues mattered and affected me more than the people around me was due to my identity. I can see myself in the tragedies that are happening, almost as if it could be myself, or any of the people I love, lying victim to these violences, but many cannot. It is a privilege to look at these human and civil rights violations, which happen daily, and think, äóìThis could never, and will never happen to me.äóŒæSo, this is why I plan on using one of the installation rooms at the 2015 BFA show to create an infinity mirror, which I plan to project an edited video montage of world events that have been haunting me into. The idea being that when the viewer stands inside the room, not only will they see themselves reflected into the space infinitely, but also they will be infinitely surrounded and unable to turn away from these pressing world and human rights issues.The proposal is due next Monday January 26th. The show is a temporary installation which would be up for public viewing for 26 days. This years show is scheduled to be installed between the dates of February 28th-March 4. The show would be up in the gallery for public viewing between March 13th-April 1. With Deinstall happening between the days of April 2-4th.Œæ"

We have collected each years donation, paid for the capsule itself, and secured its resting space. The only things left are the actual fees to cover the process itself. Even $5.00 adds up.

495," Since birth I've been a very creative person in every aspect of art, I love tattooing and photography for one of the same reason which is they both stop time and they can't be re-created that moment is gone and being apart of that moment is paramount and can't be taken away, and that's just one of the many reasons I do what I do and am trying to make it better."

497," Thisexhibition, which is curated by Erin Joyce Projects, will present the work of leading Contemporary American Indian andFirst Nations artists from across the North American continent. These artistsall actively engage the notion of pop-culture, misappropriation, andrepresentation in their work. Utilizing pastiche, they create imbricatedworks that will stand alone but enter into dialogue with one another in thegallery space. This exhibition will be in three states äóñ as a portion of theexhibition will be presented at Radiator Gallery in New York, and the Institute of American Indian Arts: Museum ofContemporary Native Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Museum of Northern Arizona, in Flagstaff, Ariona.The exhibition features work from Postcommodity, Edgar Heap of Birds, Nicholas Galanin, Dana Claxton, Marcus Amerman, and Cheyenne Randall. The exhibition serendipitously coincides with the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which will bring indigenous leaders and thinkers from all over the world to New York to discuss pressing issues affecting their tribes.ŒæThe reason fundraising needs to occur for the exhibition is to cover the costs of shipping and insurance of artworks to and from New York City from the artist(s) studio, cover the cost of travel and lodging for the artist and curator, as well as to cover the curatorial fees and catalogue printing fees.Œæ"

499," The No More Hiroshimas ProjectThis project started in a graphic design class I was taking last fall and rapidly grew into the dream of an installation and teaching event related to the 70th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.As Burlington College has a professional gallery and an Institute for Civic Engagement, I approached the gallery director with the idea of the installation, and she green lighted it! The installation and event will be in August 2015.Commemorations of the first atomic bombings are held annually across the United States and around the world, and provide a means to remind ourselves, our communities and elected officials that we continue to face the danger of nuclear annihilation, and that action for nuclear disarmament is an urgent necessity. Commemorations open spaces to educate the publicäóîespecially younger generationsäóîabout the human consequences of nuclear war. They provide forums and encouragement to plan education and organizing in the year to come. In the United States, they also provide an opportunity to face and learn from one of the most devastating acts of war in U.S. history.We must act to ensure atomic bombings never again occur.The CostsThe costs associated with this exhibit are related to both the cost of printing and mounting large scale imagery with information about the bombings, the fallout, and the long term effects of nuclear war and the nuclear era. Many of the pieces require use of historical photos, and have costs related with the use of those pieces.I have priced out their use from Corbis images and Getty Images, as well as the price for printing and mounting. The rights to use these historic images will total approximately $3500.Aside from the images and historical information on the wall, there will be a river of origami cranes hung from the ceiling, moving through the 2 rooms of the gallery. I've already folded about 1300 of them as of 2/09/2015, and envision at least twice as many! The papers I'm using vary from those readily available at places like Creative Habitat and Michael's to hand-printed, hand-made papers at $28.00 for a single sheet.The Exhibit SpaceThe exhibit will be multimedia, with historic video and various film footage airing on a loop. The open space in the center of the main room of The Gallery will be filled with meditation cushions and a live Japanese maple. There will be a table filled with directions on how to fold origami peace cranes like the ones hanging above people, origami paper for viewers to create their own crane, and black tags with ribbons on them. People will be challenged to fold a crane for peace and place if at the foot of the tree. The tags will be for commitments about what each person will commit to for peace - whether that is personal meditation, taking action, supporting the Institute for Civic Engagement, joining VPIRG, or other personal commitment.The August 6th EventOn the day of August 6th, the public will be invited to events and presentations throughout the day at Burlington College about the history of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the fight for peace in the modern world, and nuclear issues. The day will culminate in an public evening memorial ceremony by Lake Champlain.I am asking for this funding as an artist and creator of this event, not as an official representative of Burlington College."
500," In Greek mythology the Hyperboreans were a mythical people who lived ""beyond the North Wind"". Hyperbí_rea was a land that was supposed to be perfect, with the sun shining twenty-four hours a day, which to modern ears suggests a possible location within the Arctic Circle.What is Hyperbí_rea Program?I live in the region of Italy which in the past was called Magna Graecia and I found this myth very interesting for the name of my artistic project: Hyperbí_rea.My Hyperbí_rea is an incredible artistic journey of over 10,000 kilometers which will start from the village of Parabita, South Italy; it will cross the entire Europe untill the North Cape (Norway), the northernmost point of the continent; then from there it continue for another 1500 kilometers and ends in RÛ‚ga, the Baltic capital of Latvia. I will address the entire performance in solitary aboard my Vespa PX125E of 1982 and will cross 10 countries:  Why a journey by aŒæ Vespa?In addition to the remarkable performance on asphalt, the program finds its basis in the actions that I intend to achieve along the way: the art installations that will take shape in extraordinary places that I will explore. The job requires great incentives and persistent commitment and will be constantly documented through notes, drawings, photos and video. A Vespa makes the trip without a doubt full of romanticism, but, more important for me, it would guarantee independence and freedom for my movements in urban and in natural contexts.Travels by Vespa before Hyperbí_reaTo make long journeys in solitary aboarding two-wheeld vehicles is not a novelty. Finding daredevils who venture by Vespa is always more sporadic.The propensity began in the Fifties by some adventures to test themselves on board of this scooter. Giorgio Bettinelli with his 254,000 kilometers around the world is remembered as a hero of 90's and 00's.The difference with ""normal Vespa travels"" The innovation of Hyperbí_rea then other journeys by Vespa in history is summarized in the following points:Besides the arrivalHyperbí_rea will not end in RÛ‚ga. A phase of processing and performance of the material collected during the travel will follow.The program could be an interesting type of artistic action for me, and my idea is to present it again in new routes.SustainabilityHyperbí_rea will pay attention to the issue of sustainability:Required resourcesHyperbí_rea, unlike other actions of this kind, offers an unprecedented trip thanks to the artistic factor that consitute the essence of the trip.The program will take approximetly three months time. During this period I will have to face the costs of:The total cost reaches 7,000 Œ£, and also if I am asking to Kickstarter only 4,000 Œ£ I think that I could try to make my savings enough for the rest.I am grate for avery you can manage, every donation is significant. Please help me to make this great program a reality for the next April.Updates that share the creative journey as the project comes to life: Hyperbí_rea's Blog on davideleopizzi.comSome reward that I will make for youŒæSomething about the previous works"
501," Guatemala Despuí©s is an emerging artistic and curatorial collaboration betweenŒæThe New SchoolŒæandŒæCiudad de la Imaginacií_n.The project will culminate into artistic works showcasedŒæin a digital collection, joint exhibitions and public programming hosted at theŒæSheila Johnson Design Center (SJDC)Œæin New York City from April 9-29, 2015Œæand inŒæQuetzaltenango, Guatemala in June 2015.ŒæWebsite:Œæhttp://www.GuatemalaDespues.orgJoin the Facebook group for updates:Œæhttp://www.facebook.com/guatemaladespuesCollaborative Process:ŒæThe project involves a process of co-investigation and workshops with artists, curators, filmmakers, social scientists, students and community-based creative practitioners in Guatemala and New York City. The key themes and directions are developed through ongoing interviews and workshops with participants, multi-disciplinary collaborations in selected sites of interest.Creative Outcomes:ŒæGuatemala Despuí©sŒæsupports site-specific artistic investigations that may reveal, activate, provoke or transform the ways in which we understand historic memory, repression, healing and forms of utopia or dystopia emerging in Guatemala. It also critically examines the political, economic and cultural influences (including foreign policy, migration and creative exchange) between the United States and Guatemala.The projectŒæuses an experimental, inclusive and participatory approach towards engaging creative practitioners and the general public using multi-disciplinary forms of investigation and expression including performance, film, sound visual, narrative and poetry. The curatorial team selected aŒædozen multi-disciplinary artistic projectsŒæbeing developed collaboratively by overŒæ40 emerging and established Guatemalan and US-based artists.The grouping of selected proposals is notable for its wide range in themes and practices. Collaborative work was encouraged to promote interdisciplinary partnerships and diversify the impact of the projects.The submissions include Hipnosis, by Regina Jose Galindo and Alejandro Ceibal, which explores the potential of public messaging -- a practice reminiscent of conventional marketing strategies, and inspired by hypnotic therapy, but for public good.

502," Aquaponics systems are designed to circulate water from a fish tank through the vegetable garden and back to the fish tank.Œæ As the water passes through the garden, the roots of the plants extract the nutrients they need and at the same time clean the water that is returning to the fish. ŒæŒæŒæŒæThis method of growingŒæuses 80% less water thanŒæa traditional garden!ŒæŒæThis makes aquaponics ideal for growing anywhere:Œæ Desert or droughtŒæclimates, offices, homes, schools, hospitals, rooftops, or just your own backyard!Œæ The plants have a faster growth rate and can be grown closer together because they are not competing for nutrients in soil.Œæ There are a number of support mediums which can be used, both natural, such as granite, or man-made, such as expanded clay.Œæ Because the system is raised, it is isolated from the soil, andŒæthere are no weeds.Only we make art around this system and make it beautifulŒæcustomŒæfit to your imagination.We build with nature's pride!!TO SUM IT UP:There is no watering, there is no weeding, your plants grow faster and produce more vegetablesŒæin smaller areas.Œæ The plants are grown at ""counter height"" so there is no bending over to tend to them! You are also raising an edible protein source, the fish!Once your system is set up and running, a normal day consists of throwing a handful of food to your fish.Œæ Planting and harvesting can literally be done in minutes. Requiring only about 15 minutes a day of your time on the average, you will find yourself spending time in your garden because you want to, not because you have to!WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT:I started with two 100 plant systems (these systems we nowŒæcall ""Old Faithful""); each 100 plantŒæsystem takes up a 5äó» X 20äó» space or 100 sq. ft.Œæ This includes a 16 square foot divided äóìnurseryäó and six 10 foot flow pipes, each containing 14 plant stations for a total of 84 individual plant stations and 16 + in the äóìnurseryäó.ŒæŒæ We now have created the 200 plant system (""The Food Factory) which takes up a 5' x 30' space or 150 sq. ft.ŒæŒæThis system has 168 plant stations plus room for 32+ plants in the ""nursery"".Œæ (Each nursery has the capacity for hundreds of small plants.)The fish tanks have a capacity of 200 gallons.

503," Our vision is to create and deliver an audio-visual experience.  Crave is not only our project title it is the sensation we want our audience to leave with.With that in mind we have collaborated with several artist to come up with a style direction that has the potential to leave an everlasting impression.  Using live DJäó»s, live visuals, projection installations, and luminescent ambiance, the treatment feels unrestricted with the lack of boundaries between what is real, and what is surreal äóñ it is limitless, infinite, and therefore boundless.Project Crave is an alliance between artists meant to remind people that we must live every moment.  The world is changing so rapidly if we donäó»t stop to live every once and awhile things will pass us by.  This project is a fusion of talent, heart, and hope brought together to inspire people to strive to find the fun in all aspects of their existence.Whenever they think back, their Craveings will remind them of the one spring night they entered another world full of neon paintings, beams of light, and the crowd they danced the night away with. "
504," Currently, what we call ""The Tea House"" will be the focal point of the farm where educational workshops and cultural events will take place. ŒæWe prefer to use natural building materials such as Bay Leaf for the thatch roofs and local hard wood. ŒæThe Tea House has a roof completed but is in need of financial assistance to finish the flooring. ŒæOnce built, the Tea House will host speakers and artists (eg. local healers speaking about holistic healing, local maya potters teaching traditional pottery, etc), environmental awareness and conservation discussions through talks and documentary showings. ŒæWe also would like to develop the Tea House as a resting place for locals and travelers where they can enjoy eating and drinking organically grown super fruits (cacao, noni, sour sop etc), fresh juices, and herbal tonics made from local medicinal herbs growing wild on the farm. ŒæA cabin industry bottling these tonic drinks and natural cosmetics will provide work for local women and men living in the area of San Antonio village.Once we receive our financial goal through Kickstarter, the funding will be put to:Œæ*Building materials for the Tea House and renewing existing accommodations*Purchasing solar batteries and solar panels to power the Tea House and upgrading the existing solar powered electrical system*Sound equipment (speakers, mic etc.)We currently host travelers and volunteers that have come to explore the maya ruins and organic farm life.

He is a third generation military veteran, having served in Chinaäó»s Peopleäó»s Liberation Army during the Sino-Vietnamese war.Guoäó»s work is heavily influenced by the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966äóñ76, the late 1970s, early 1980s war with Vietnam, and the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 äóñ in which he participated as a protestor. After the events of 1989, Guo Jian became a pioneer of the Chinese avant-garde art scene, and a founding member of the famousŒæYuanmingyuan Artist Village.Guo Jian was recently exiled from China, after he completed a morbid diorama of Tiananmen Square, which he covered in ground meat and left to rot. (Financial TimesŒæ1Œæ2Œæ3,ŒæCNN). After worldwide coverage of his arrest and detainment, Guo was deported and separated from his family, ending up in Sydney.

He has won awards for his service in Kuwait City during the Gulf War, and afterwards became interested in showing the harsh realities of wartime, and how it changed him and his peers. He is an environmental activist with notable projects that have garnered media attention. Now based in LA, Marcus earned his PhD in Science Education and has the skills to work withŒæmetal, wood, paint, and even animal flesh. Through art-as-activism, he has brought attention to the plight of Hurricane Katrina victims, plastic in the worldäó»s oceans, the material refuse and rubble that results from armed conflict, the shame of surviving conflict, and the sadness of fallen soldiers.Œæ ŒæEmerging CollectiveŒæis a non-profit art initiative, creating dialogue between the First World and the Emerging Markets through the prism of art.

With an emphasis on activist and avant-garde art, Emerging Collective aims to catapult the most promising creatives to the forefront of the global art scene, and serve as a cultural change-agent for the next generation.HOW IT WORKSThe program consists of a dual artist-in-residency program and a collaborative exhibition äóñ one globally recognized artist and one top emerging talent. One of these artists will come from the first world, and the other will come from the emerging markets. The mentorship relationship will be solidified in their collaboration.First, they will create a piece in the disused space chosen. The creative process will be live streamed, and the work will be on auction from the moment the work begins, ending when the work is complete. They will also collaborate on an immersive concept and build it together. ŒæThe exhibition will be centered around these two artworks.During the exhibition, Emerging Collective will curate intimate discussions with the artists, as well as other culturally relevant programming in the exhibition space.Œæ The mentorship relationship, and the immersive work that is produced from it, will be the result ofŒænorth-south dialogue. This will be a transcendent artwork that neither artist could have imagined alone, and will be Emerging Collectiveäó»s biggest contribution to humanity äóñ to literally push culture forward.Œæ"

508," Holmes County äóî the heart of Ohio's Amish Country äóî is rich in many ways, but lacks a stage for artistic and cultural exchange and especially, has no outlet for local artists and no place for residents and visitors to explore and experience artwork.ŒæWith the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum, we want to establish an entirely new museum to create an illuminating way to experience the work of local artists.The Holmes County Open Air Art Museum will beŒæa collection of artwork, sculptures, earthworks, and any other creations permanently installed outside and unprotected from the natural elements. It will be art that you can walk through, gaze up at, and witness in each changing season, art that constantly evolves against the backdrop of rural farmland and forested trails.With this Museum, we have the unique opportunity to create a new creative space, built by our community and influenced by the artists whose work will fill it. Help us make this vision a reality!My name is Jason Nies and I am the person behind the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum and the owner of The Inn at Honey Run, a boutique hotel in Millersburg, Ohio. The Inn has great potential as a new venue for creative output in this community, a dream I've harbored since helping create a community for artists called Junctionview Studios in Grandview, Ohio.ŒæNow, for the first time, comes the opportunity to build something permanently inspiring that can spread the impact of art to Central Ohio. With your help, the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum will ignite conversation, drive thought, provoke emotion, and leave a lasting impression on each visitor. There is a great need for more creativity and cultural exchange outside of the urban environment, and especially here in Holmes County.Around the world, rural locales are enriched and enhanced with public art äóî many countries in Europe and several in Asia and South America have an open air art museum. Even the United States has several variations of an open air art museum or sculpture garden.ŒæThis is not so in Holmes County, Ohio. There is a vast, empty canyon of culture and open air art in this part of Ohio that will be filled by the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum,Œæwith the help of all of our backers.Aside from becoming a vital part of the culture here, the Holmes County Open Air Art Museumäó»s location will set it apart from existing spaces. At the center of the largest Amish settlement in the world, the beautiful rolling hills and natural tranquility of our area allow visitors to shed the outside world and freely engage in the artistsäó» imagination and vision.The museumäó»s location äóî adjacent to The Inn at Honey Run and set on our 50-acre property äóî is an added advantage. The Inn is already a tranquil place for contemplation and retreat, surrounded by lush forest and hillside meadows.ŒæHere, the land and art are secure and will be protected and nourished for generations, for visitors and locals alike to appreciate.ŒæSo far, 25 local Ohio artists have shown interest in becoming the first to create and display their work at the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum. Immediately after reaching our initial funding goal, we will establish formal agreements with the artists to plan their installations and schedule their opening days. Each artist will participate in the opening of his or her piece and will interact with the supporters and co-creators of the museum. In the long term, we will not limit eligibility to Ohio artists, but we feel this is fitting for the initial 15 installations, a chance to grow the Museum with pride in local talent.ŒæThere are no requirements for materials or media to be used in the artwork. We will encourage and seek out a variety of styles and media to provide a range of materials from natural to recycled. The vision and creativity of each artist will dominate the works of art.ŒæWe are a typical small business äóî we make enough money to maintain the Inn, but we canäó»t take in enough revenue to fund a project of this scope and pay professional artists a fair commission for their work. This is the same reason most art museums are funded by wealthy patrons.ŒæOur goal is to fund the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum with thousands of small donations and create a museum that truly values the public and the artists. This model ensures that artists are free to create their masterpieces without the influence or expectations of a powerful board of directors äóî the artists will have full control over the Museum collection as it takes shape.ŒæWe've calculated a need for $50,000 to commission and install the first five works of art. Every dollar contributed beyond this amount will go toward more artwork. My dream is to raise $150,000 or more so we can open the Museum with 15 permanent pieces. Your support will make this a reality and help create an emotionally moving art experience for thousands of people.ŒæŒæWe are deeply and truly appreciative of all who will be a part of bringing unique, large-scale artwork to Ohioäó»s Amish Country. It is not often that we can be a part of the creation of an entirely new artistic space and museum, and we are extremely excited to build a community of passionate art lovers.ŒæThe rewards we are offering are designed to provide a truly unique and immersive experience for our art-loving backers, from an invitation to be a patron of art in Holmes County to a nightäó»s stay with us at The Inn at Honey Run and a private reception with the artist.ŒæWant to give a reward as a gift? Youäó»ll have a chance to let us know that youäó»re making a pledge on someone elseäó»s behalf once the project is over. Just let us know who should receive the reward on the follow-up survey. You'll be invited to walk the grounds of the museum after some of the first artworks are installed. Be among the first to experience the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum!We'll host an opening reception for each installation, inviting the artist and our backers to celebrate together. Like a gallery opening, our receptions will be held at the Inn, surrounded by nature and artwork, with hors d'oeuvres, refreshments and a presentation from the artist.ŒæA special rewards tier for our earliest backers. A pledge at this level is not only a strong vote of support, but also an opportunity to witness the creation of the Museum. Early Backers are invited to stay at The Inn at Honey Run during the installation of a piece of art, experiencing both the Inn's tranquility and its new identity as an artistic haven.ŒæGolden Guests are invited for the whole package äóî a big thank you for being a part of the museum every step of the way. Join one of our artists and fellow backers at one of the private opening receptions with a presentation by the artist, hors d'oeuvres andŒærefreshments, followed by an overnight stay at the Inn.ŒæAfter an opening reception with the artists, spend a night in one of our private and secluded earth-sheltered Club LevelŒæHoneycombŒærooms. Each room features a gas fireplace and private patio overlooking our sheep meadow (and the sunrise each morning), and this reward includes complimentary full breakfast.ŒæThe Inner Circle offers an incomparably intimate evening with one of the artists of the Museum. First, join fellow backers and art lovers at an opening reception with a presentation by the artist, hors d'oeuvres andŒærefreshments. Inner Circle members will alsoŒæbe invited to a gourmet, five-course dinner with the artist at the Inn's restaurant, Tarragon. A night's stay in the inn's luxuriousŒæaccommodations on the night of the reception is also included.We will begin installing the first work of art in April 2015 and we will open a new piece every three weeks after that for a total of 10 installations in 2015. This is dependent on your support and whether we can stretch our initial goal of five works of art to the dream of 15. If we do, beginning in April 2016 we will add the next five pieces in three-week intervals and conclude this initial period of growth with a grand unveiling and the first Art Festival at the Holmes County Open Air Art Museum.Your support is just the beginning of the museum. My vision calls for a continually growing collection, an annual art festival, and an artist residency program.We will add two to three new permanent art pieces to the collection each year going forward after the initial 15 works are installed. These will be funded by the The Inn at Honey Run, made possible by the increased visitors to the museum.During the summer of 2016, we will host the first Art Festival Week on the grounds allowing artists working in all media to display, perform, and ignite art for the public and create a living art experience.The third part of the plan calls for a permanent cottage with a work studio to be built along the museum trail, which will allow one artist to live here for a period of time to work on his or her next creative endeavor.In 2002, my family decided to take a trip to Latvia, where my motheräó»s side originated. My grandmotheräó»s health was deteriorating and we wanted to have the opportunity to share this trip back to her native land with her. During the trip, I had the opportunity to visit the Open Air Art Museum at Pedvale. My imagination awakened as I walked around the landscape, taking in the works of art. Iäó»d always appreciated art and enjoyed the museum experience, but this cool June day in Latvia uncovered a passion for interacting with art in an open air format. Iäó»ve been looking for an opportunity to start something like this in the United States ever since.ŒæOther inspirational open air art museums include Inhotim inŒæBrumadinho, Brazil; Middleheim Museum in Antwerp, Belgium; and Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, NY.Museums are created and maintained by the wealthy individuals of this world because money is needed and they control the finances. My dream is to expand the honor and duty of bringing art to the world to everyday people, people who love art and want to share this love with their fellow inhabitants of this earth.ŒæIn this way, the barrier of wealth is destroyed and the joy of curating art is now attainable by every person who so chooses. I encourage you to join in this dream and permanently etch your name in the history of HC-OAAM while giving the world a new way to create museums. Come, help us define this new museum experience.   I have been the owner of The Inn at Honey Run for five years, and I have spent the last five years improving and fixing up the property. I have been developing new businesses and creating new concepts throughout my career. Before owning the Inn, I owned an art studio building in Grandview, Ohio and an Antique Mall (Heritage Square Antique Mall) in Columbus, Ohio.ŒæOne of my first opportunities to bring art into my professional life came in 2003, with the creation of Junctionview Studios in Grandview, Ohio, just outside of downtown Columbus. A close friend of mine was attending the nearby Columbus College of Art and Design, and we saw the need for a creative space open to all media, one that would unite the urban community and celebrate the beauty of the neighborhood. I collaborated with the owners of a former plastics warehouse and we set about remodeling the facility to fit our needs. Within this relatively-small warehouse of about 25,000 square feet, we created 20 studios and three larger spaces: a dance studio, a childrenäó»s art center, and a 3,000-square-foot gallery.ŒæThe energy was alive at our first show in October of 2003 äóî we knew Junctionview was a success. It was a place where the art community and the general public could cross paths. After two years, I moved on to my next project, leaving a collaborative group of artists to lead Junctionview. The space thrived until 2013, when it succumbed to economic pressure for a new apartment community.Œæ"

510," The beginning of my move into art happened during a time when life had defeated me. After under-bidding the largest print contract of my career, things went south. I nearly lost everything making delivery on my print contract.Financially wiped out and depressed, I had lost the will to continue my business with the same determination and drive. Rather than work, I began to sift through my college photography. I started printing random photos that I liked. My roommate at the time was encouraging me along the way. One of these images was a stained glass Jesus that I took at night time in Phoenix.I had the idea to print using colored material rather than white. I had a huge mix of results The stained glass Jesus image was an interesting image to work with. I began printing it on different colors of material. This was my way of not working. I was now playing with my printer rather than printing the usual boring marketing material.Since I usually work with adhesive materials, I started mounting the prints onto spray painted backgrounds. Between printing and spray painting, I had found a happy distraction from work and my professional career.ŒæOne evening a guest who was over saw some of the work. She asked how much I would sell one for. Ding! In a moment, I understood that I could become an artist. I was taken back and had no answer for a price.To make a long story short, all of the sudden I had almost 75 of these 8x10 Jesus plaques. I didn't know what to do with them, so I decided to start framing them. I made it a dogmatic practice to finish one or two each Sunday. Some of the frames are made by me and some of them are second-hand. There are only a few which I did not work on the frame.Once again - to make a long story short, all of the sudden I have an office full of Jesus's, and its time for them to find new homes. I am raising funds to re-locate from the snow and into warmer climates (AZ). In the spirit of dogmatic practice, I am running this kickstarter until my birthday, and am seeking to raise $333 dollars towards my move.ŒæŒæThese are the remaining un-framed plaques.ŒæHere is the collection of Jesus with frames!"
511," The Tappäó»s Initiative is a juried Artist-in-Residency Program (AiRP), developed by Friends of the Tapp's Arts CenterŒæ(a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity), that aims to bring contemporary art production, practice and community engagement to the Columbia/Midlands area. ŒæEach resident will have full access to their own studio space for four months. Throughout this time, the resident artist will realize a site-specific project, and invite the public to discuss and interact with the contemporary artwork during several open-gallery events. We believe the interactive aspect of our project is unique, and will benefit the community by furthering an understanding of contemporary art issues, modes of practice and how visual language functions in 'building' culture, both locally and abroad. Moreover, the emerging artist selected for the Artist-in-Residency Program will benefit from both professional and personal growth. For emerging artists, the completion of an art residency program is paramount for launching any artist career. At the end of the four month studio time, the resident artist will close with an exhibition of work produced during the time in the space. Tapp's Arts Center (TAC) will host an opening reception, as well as an artist discussion during the run of the show.Those who give to The Tappäó»s Initiative will help foster an important, but still missing, piece of Columbia's art landscape. You will be participating in the cultural and artistic growth of our city, and the money earned through this campaign will help cover facilities cost, marketing, educational and support materials, and most importantly, it will allow us to provide financial support to the artist in the program by way of a stipend. We believe artists should be able to participate in the local economy while at the same time producing cultural and artistic contributions.Studio Rental (4 months): 1200Materials (Exhibition/Studio): 1000Stipend: 1500Administration/Marketing: 300Total Cost: $4000Our space is a 23,000 square foot contemporary art gallery located in the downtown Columbia, South Carolina.

513," The Nicholas Lawson General Studies Building Project isintended to be constructed in such a way so that for the period of time that itis so that it takes itäó»s place as the tallest building on a University Campusin the University System. The purpose of this is the generate public interestand inspire competition among high school students forthe purpose of competing to enroll at aUniversity of Cincinnati program that would be known as the University ofCincinnati General Studies Program.This 11 Story building would ask for Freshmen to give theirfinal presentations starting at the top floor of the Nicholas Lawson GeneralStudies Building. The presentations these students would give wouldcomprehensively detail their experiences in studying abroad on their classäó»schoice of continent. Thesubsequentyears would entail the students spending nine months as a class experiencingthat which every continent has to offer.The basement of the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Buildingwould house a data center where students as they are traveling around the worldand experiencing life abroad while gaining perspective on the GlobalCommunications Network would be where the students store their diverse andvaried Multi Media Creations in the forms of Text Documents, Video Documents,Audio Documents, and Photography Documents.The students would in fact spend nine months out of eachyear for their first seven years of study experiencing in full detail eachcontinent. They would then spend the final three months of each of their firstseven years of study and travel in the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Buildingworking collaboratively on their final presentations. Each years the studentsare to give their presentations on their respective floor representative oftheir year in the program with their first year being the year that they givetheir class presentations in the first floor and their subsequent years givingtheir presentations on each level lower.The final four years of the program would ask students toexperience and recover from the culture shock that would be experienced and tocollectively work together to detail their inspiration that they wouldexperience. They would be expected to organically over the first seven years oftheir studies and travel to collect a professional contacts lists that theywould be expected to naturally keep in touch with.These students would spend their final year on the groundfloor of the Nicholas Lawson General Studies Building working to create a finalpresentation that explains and details their by this point global inspiredmindset and would be asked to explore and understand how best to navigateglobal issues up to and including drafting writing as to how best to go aboutnavigating the Global Warming issue that is presently being discussed andunderstood in society at large.This is a program that is intended to produce global mindedcitizens equipped with competitive stories in society at large that stem fromhaving an understanding in some form of what life is like on each of the sevencontinents.It is understood that in a globally networked societyinterlinked with a global communications network that training students and youthto think globablly through the process of experiencing globe that they wouldthen be able to in enhanced fashion function more professionally on a locallevel pulling on their diverse international contacts to aid them inaccomplishing their future goals and furthering their respective communities withthe aid of their cumulative experiences amassed in their 11 year universitystudies.The funding that this Kickstarter Program is asking for willbe used to offset the costs of creating the first draft of a set of plans forthe building and will be issued to a local Architecture Firm to begin the firstphase of a presentation to initiate this program.I hope you find this idea inspiring and that you feel thatthis undertaking would be beneficial to the Global Community in such a way thatyou open your pocket book and help promote the futuresäó» ability to better andmore thoroughly understand the needs of the leadership in the future and theunderstanding that it would be a program like this that would enable futureclasses of Students to promote understanding and communication in a GlobalSociety.

518," Many haunted attractions are geared toward quick jump-scares and blood-and-gore type props, and tend to rush people through small violent scenes to achieve the scare effect. What if instead of relying on that quick fear response or the shock factor of bloody visuals, there was a haunt that really makes people feel as though they are in a whole new world first? If it feels that real, then surely the fear and terror will be that much more real too, once the creatures show up...This year I have a smaller goal - I want to put some of my skills into practice, so I can be more prepared for a better, bigger, and much scarier haunt next year.ŒæThis campaign is to help me fund materials to provide a neat little haunted walk that even my 3-year-old Niece would be able to go on without feeling scared.

Mike, ageneral contractor, and I, not so great with a hammer, but with a good eye forart, will provide the labor.WITH YOUR HELPThe money we raise from this Kickstarter will go to:Materials needed to strip, refinish and refurbish walls,floors and furniture of the Land Commander.Paint and replacement parts for the exterior of the LandCommander.Interior additions such as Plexigas enclosures, lighting,curtains, signage, printed materials, and other items for the purse exhibits.Additional cost of insurance for our tow vehicle, a 1966Ford F-100.Cost of rewards for this project.THE BACKSTORYIäó»m in the process of receiving my certificate in Art Museumand Gallery Studies from California State University, East Bay. Iäó»m a studentmember of the American Alliance of Museums, and Iäó»m a member of the AntiquePurse Collectoräó»s Society.I also own vintage purses. Lots and lots of wonderful vintage purses,collected over nearly three decades. So many purses that my husband built ahuge room in our house, just for my vintage collection. And for Faith theMannequin.Uhäó_ welläó_ Southern Californiaäó_After consulting with business executives and other professionals, I realizedit would be way too costly. If my dream of having a purse museum were to come to fruition, it'd have to be unique. And cheap. Really, really cheap.Which is why we got the Land Commander, which cost $1,300and included possessions from the previous owner, most of which were veryyucky.We've already started the process of cleaning it up and tearing it down. (Thank you, inventorof rubber gloves.) Weäó»re now considering several design options, includingcreating large side doors that swing out to allow complete viewing of the exhibit withoutstepping inside the RV.But first, it needs to be stripped, refinished and putback together. After thatäó_WHERE THE HANDBAG MEETS THE HIGHWAYIf our goal is met, we plan to take the purses on the roadto events such as vintage fashion expos, RV äóìglampingäó rallies, andto businesses, museums and residences that will allow us to temporarily park ontheir lots so visitors can have a unique, entertaining and educational vintage fashion experience. Due to the RVäó»sspace constraints and the enormity of the full collection, the exhibits will berotated on a regular basis.The Rolling Vintage Purse Museum will be FREE. Thatäó»s rightäóîweare NOT going to charge admission.If our goal is exceeded, we will use the funds to pay forcontinued expenses for the RV Purse Museum, as well as update The Vintage PurseGalleryäó»s website to make it a much more comprehensive, interactive, yet stillŒæFREEŒæonline experience for visitors the world over.To check out our progress, you can visit RVPurseMuseum.com.For more about The Vintage Purse Gallery, visitVintagePurseGallery.com, and for the blog that started it all, Vintage Purse aDay, go to VintagePurse.blogspot.com.On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vintagepursegalleryTwitter: @VintagePurseGalEmail: info@vintagepursegallery.comThank you for your support!"

I love weaving patterns into 3 dimensional spaces. The results are colorful, soft, and unique. My material of choice is yarn. As a child, I was taught to knit scarves, to crochet hats, and to weave wall-hangings by my mother, aunt, and other women. I honor these lessons from my maternal lineage in these antique craft methods while making them mine. I let go of the knitting needles and the clumsy crochet hooks, expand the scale, and turn my hands into the tools. The soft texture, lightweight nature, and infinite possibilities of yarn, ribbon and string inspire me to draw by hand crocheting.  I begin each piece with one strand of yarn. As the fiber emerges from the wound-up ball, a line is formed and a drawing in space begins. The yarn spirals, folds, and creates pattern. I feel like I am tracing constellations or weaving a huge spider web. As the pattern emerges from empty space, the air becomes thick with soft layers of yarn. Loops and lines form the web, creating a network of colorful lines and shapes. Each fiber installation is a maze, a net, a dream catcher and a burst of color. The spaces between the lines create shapes and allow each piece to remain lightweight. I have been weaving these webs since 2001. Each web is inspired by a unique space, season, and life experience. I choose colors and yarn textures to reflect my experiences, to express my inner self. As I create these tactile pieces, I am surrounded by the yarn, often becoming entangled. Each web is created over a period of weeks or months and is a meditation. When people see my work, my wish is that they see something they have never seen before and find inspiration.  Have a creative day- build inspiration- bring vision to realityŒæLOVE & GRATITUDE!!!"

533," I'm building an 8ft by 12 ft Dungeon Family Pyramid on the Atlanta's beltline. Why? Well I want to create a semi permanent monument that pays homage to the creative achievement of the Dungeon Family.ŒæTo me, pyramids are a symbol to the viewer that something significant has occurred here. It's a reference to mastery of one's self. In this the capstone is not the all seeing eye but the soul. It will be illuminated by solar powered LED lights but at night, we would like those lights to be lasers. Lasers that will light up as a symbol of the DF creative endeavors and investment in funk.The pyramid structures that have been left behind from ancient civilizations rival or even surpass modern construction in just about every continent. The Pyramid is a remnant of a society that celebrates the mastery of its architecture, culture and wisdom. The concept of this design was crafted from inspiration of these processes and honestly, Ancient Aliens, a show I watch religiously on H2. Although the original, functional, purpose of this type of structure is unknown, the visceral effect of the architectural mastery is not lost on the viewer. Similar to seeing a sculpture by Michelangelo or the colossal heads on Easter Island, not having access to the back story on the creation of the piece does not take away from the feeling that what you are seeing is indeed lasting.The Dungeon Family Pyramid will be an artistic homage to their iconic achievements. As nomadic travelers view it, even if they are unaware of the cultural influence of the artists who will be depicted on the structure, it will be evident by the style and representation of the figures that they hold great significance.In the future, I would like to create monuments like these combining ancient ruins with prominent hip hop artists. I want these structures to be made of materials that would last thousands of years. So when archaeologist find these installations they will know of the hip hop culture that preceded them and it was a mighty thing."
534," I am super excited of being invited to take part in the (e)merge Art Fair in Washington, DC (October 2 - 5, 2014). ŒæParticipating in this show will be fantastic exposure for me and I can't miss it! ""The (e)merge art fair returns for a fourth year with the 2014 edition. Last year, the fair featured an international roster of over 80 exhibitors presenting works by 150 artists from 30 countries. Exhibitors will show new works in painting, sculpture, video, performance, installation, and other media. For four days, the public is welcome to view a carefully curated selection of emerging art at the Capitol Skyline Hotel, exhibited on three levels inside the hotel and throughout the hotel's grounds and public spaces.The (e)merge Artist Platform presents a vetted selection of works by independent artists displayed throughout the hoteläó»s public areas. (e)merge is the only art fair that gives free exhibition space to artists without gallery representation. The 2014 (e)merge Vetting Committee members are: AI WEIWEI, artist, Beijing; MIKA YOSHITAKE, assistant curator, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; and JEFFREEN M. HAYES, director, Rebuild Foundation, Chicago, St. Louis & Omaha.""My project will be a site specific installation:Medium: Drafting film, ink, acrylic, LED tape lightThree large pieces of drafting film are floating vertically from the ceiling, in the middle of the exhibition space, away from a wall. The dimensions will be 36 x 85 inches. The pieces will consist out of two layers of drafting film in front of each other. It is an experiment of layers of material and colors, superpositions and exposures. Ink colors condensate and vanish, sheer areas appear. Delicate, fragmental drawings grow out of colorfields. Fragments and segements of our daily environment become visible. ŒæDrawn elements of plastic wrapping materials capture the plastic material of the artwork itself and create artificial nature illusions. Seven inches behind the floating artwork two more sheets of drafting film will be hanging from the ceiling. An LED tape light is installed in between them. The light sheets will be white and clear, showing the routing of the LED tape light.In this concept everything circles around the gearing of color, fragmental drawings, light and space. Generally, the materials originate from technical and industrial coherencies (LED light, plastic materials) which enactment breathes a poetic buoyancy and softness. It is a constructive skeleton, that encounters translucent and transparent materials, and which joins together in an overall context. It is the context of countless plastic usage, such as of plastic wrapping and bags in our daily lives.Thank you for your support.Joana"
535," My little family resides at St. Joe Lofts and have done so since the spring of 2011. I've had this idea of a large installation festering for well over a year and it came simply from slight jealousy. St Joe Lofts is an Artist Community in the Warehouse Arts District and there are gorgeous paintings (some sculpture too) temporarily provided by the residents of our community and displayed inside the main building where it is, essentially, a ""live in"" gallery. Now, here's the rub: The part of the building where I and others dwell...well, our apartment doors open to the outside and THERE IS NO ART!!!!!! Such a shame, don't you think? To amend this, I'm reaching out to you to fulfill this huge vision, along with smaller pieces to help round out 3 stories worth of outdoor space.The complete installation will be ready for the Art 4 Art's Sake event on October 4th, 2014 from 6-9PM. The installation will be up for the rest of October and pieces will be available for purchase or sent off as rewards. One large piece from the installation will be donated to St. Joe Lofts. ŒæAlso, a few smaller pieces (3 ft X 5 ft) Œæwill be donated to my son's middle school with the potential to extend to other schools in the Greater New Orleans Area!ŒæProjected Supplies needed: cement board, Zinssser Bulls Eye Primer, Thompson's Water Seal, Behr Exterior Satin, Ram Board, Deep Well Tray Liners, Drop Cloths, Rollers, Paint Brushes, 5 gal bucket. The estimate for framing the larger pieces has been estimated at 450 (at minimum) for supplies and labor. Additional lighting will be needed as well. Excess funds will cover the Artist's fee to go towards rent, childcare expenses, and snacks (my 13 year old son suggested this). If you have any questions, please ask!Please note: the painting behind my little family is my neighbor's!

536," The VisionThe group of artists have been going to Burning Man for the last 10 years, as time goes by, the 10 principles are imprinted deeper with each trip home.They have made friends all over the world, appreciated the art installations on the playa. This year, through the collaboration of artists from Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, South Bay, China, they are building ""Hua Biao"" on the playa.""Hua Biao"" goes back 4000 years in Chinese history, it used to be erected along the major arterial roadside for people to leave messages to the emperors anonymously. Later Huabiao are made of granite stones for durability and serve the same purpose. Our ""Hua Biao"" will be a place for people to leave messages for their beloved ones, we will also have meditation, Yoga around the base.ŒæAt night ""Hua Biao"" is illuminated and will serve as bus stop. It's a beautiful place for gather, meditate and send the messages to you loved ones.GoalOur goal is to raise enough money to construct Hua Biao for many tens of thousands of Burners to enjoy it on the playa.The amount we are looking to raise just covers the material costs and transportation service. The following is a main list of breakdowns of the costs:$2300: lumbers, 8ft 2x4 60 pieces, 4x8 plywoods 24 pieces, 8ft 4x4Œæ 9 pieces, rebar, fasteners, screws, nails, tie downs. $1200: tools, workspace shop, extra length ladders$1000: Penske Truck Rentals to San Francisco CA to Black Rock City, NV, gasoline, $500: exterior lights, interior lights, batteries, control set up.$300: paints, fabrics, clothes, for decorating the huabiao$600: fuels, lanterns, solar panelsOur $6000 goal is conservative and cover the materials, we would be very honored and graceful to receive your kind contribution, also you are welcome to visit us on the playa. Please show your support and help us to make this project live. A big THANK YOU !"
537," Unfortunately I only have a card holder.The project will highlight the spectacle of capitalism, where worth is only perceived, and not taken at humanitarian value. I have obtained a wallet, but I need varying tokens of wealth with which to fill it.As the wallet grows, the piece becomes more relevant, and the constant evolution of this piece with varying arrangements and net worth will detail the virile nature of capitalism."
538," I'm building cardboard models of 10 different ships, 4 large grids and 200 pegs. I'm calling the project ""Small Craft Invasion."" The concept is similar to the popular game ""'Battleship,"" but with hand built, one of a kind boats on a larger scale. The finished game can be played outdoors or indoors, installed in a gallery or at a neighborhood block party to be enjoyed by children and adults. The funds raised will mostly cover time by the artist to make the models. The materials are mostly recycled."

To have the opportunity to share concepts and techniques while doing my own research to create a future installation. Phase 1-The initial project begins with a lecture and workshop co-taught with myself and the Professors from ISA involving video, lithography, photo etching and screen printing. Students will be paired, one video artist and one traditional printmaker.Œæ Students will be asked to work collaborativelyŒæto create portions for a final installation involving video and traditional printmaking. Œæ Phase 2- Works and portions of works will be taken back to Calgary, Canada where students and invited artists will be asked to pair up and further develop the work. The goal is to establish relationships, share knowledge, develop a collaborative project for exhibition in the two countries.ŒæThere are very limited materials available for the students, it is my goal to raise funds to buy materials for video editing and printmaking that will be donated to the University for student use.

541," Œæ Œæ ŒæA Completed 15ft tall (4 ft. wide and 35 ft. long) stationary sculpture of two ants made of riveted sheets of metal working together to lift a flaming heart in the shape of an archway. People may walk under and around the arch that is created by the ants that will also be rgb lit, wants to visit Element 11 and needs some assistance.Œæ Œæ ŒæLast year was my first year at Element 11 the Utah Regional Burning man Festival, and we experienced something that was truly unique. We had a burn-cation, a burn where we just came to play! Very rare event for the WelDid crew, and we grew to love the uniqueness that the Utah regional had to offer. The jelly fish, the fishies, the CRAZY BURN ANYTHING VIBE!!!  We are coming back again this year (YAY!), but we want to PARTICIPATE this time! Unfortunately we do not have the personal funds to transport this sculpture and supply it with propane out to Utah and back. So the WelDid Crew is graciously asking for help so that we can rent a trailer, pay for gas hauling it, and get a 100lb propane tank to supply MAXIMUM FIRE!  We built this sculpture with the hopes that the image of ants holding a flaming heart, made by a group of neophyte äóìartistsäó (a pharmacy tech, stagehands, and tire technician) would travel around as far and wide as possible so that people may be inspired  too find what puts fire in their heart, and if they cannot do it themselves work together!!  Below is a description of the original inspiration for the project and a description of the completed sculptureŒæ Œæ Œæ The inspiration behind this piece arrived when my brother was explaining the idea of emergence as a theme to me, and his analogy of a single ant vs. a colony of ants and what they can accomplish. I was struck at that moment immediately with what type of piece I would like to attempt this year and with help this idea evolved into two ants working together holding a flaming heart as an arch way. I look at the ants working together as a natural progression of what I learned working on Prima Materia,  a project that was influenced by Carl Jungäó»s explanation of individuation, as becoming äóìaware of oneself, of oneäó»s make-up, and the way to discover oneäó»s true, inner selfäó. Creating with a large group of people on that project I developed the utmost respect and appreciation for people working together to create more advanced projects and mentalities. A good team can accomplish anything, if one can recognize and push their own skills and abilities. Thus Prima allowed me to develop my sense of community and teamwork into a heartfelt passion that I would love to express through this sculpture. Œæ Œæ ŒæThe sculpture consists of two ants that are reared up on their hind legs, holding a heart between them in a type of archway that is tall enough for people to walk under. They are made out of buffed and riveted together steel sheets, so that they will reflect the flames from the heart in a playful and interesting manner. The structure is made of high gauge steel welded together and designed to support the weight of the sculpture, and come apart at the head, thorax, and abdomen using bolts for transportation.ŒæŒæ Œæ ŒæI hope to place the sculpture in an area where people may walk under it to enter something of significance (depends on where itäó»s placed). I will also place benches around it so that people may sit and act as if they are one of the fellow ants, or ponder the community around them, while appreciating and encouraging future involvement! During the night the sculpture has flames that dance inside of the heart with the propane line running out to a box that contains the propane tank, and rgb flood lights placed inside of the sculpture that will adjust speed and color manually depending on the energy of the crowd (battery inside thorax, or easily adaptable to normal plug in wiring if available). I like very much to see pieces in multiple aspects thought out the event, lights on no flame, lights on with flame, flame only, and during the daytime so people can see the piece multiple times and not have it be the same. This will allow the piece to interact with them visually and possibly mirror how their feelings are evolving during the event, making each experience unique.  Œæ Œæ ŒæThe flame effects on this sculpture are not a poofer type effect but the playfulness and the simplicity of flame. I also think this will be a swell thing for people to take pictures under, and one of my favorite things to see after event is the continued inspiration in the community through our digital lives. I anticipate allowing many people to ponder the fire in their hearts and continue pursuing what puts it there! "

544," Imagine yourself for a moment, discovering the followingäó_You struggle to comprehend exactly what you're seeing from a distance. Curiosity beckons and you approach, but the architecture is complex and hard to decipher. It's big, that much you know. It seems to be a geodesic dome, of which you've seen many. Nay, it seems to be several domes, one towering above the others, which surround their greater counterpart at it's outer edge, their circumferences touching. The struts of the domes are black, and the whole thing reminds you of a gothic spiderweb, mildly sinister in appearance. There is no skin on the structure, and you can see people inside. They're congregated in the center, sitting on couches and benches, or reclined around low tables at the periphery. While it isn't quite apparent what exactly you're seeing, there seems to be a flat plane of flame swirling and morphing about towards the peak of the dome, and a mysterious orange glow illuminates the interior space. Suddenly and without warning, bursts of fire erupt from the peaks of several of the smaller hemispheres. Flame shoots upwards forcefully and at random, like an erratic heartbeat. These spurts are soon dwarfed by the central dome's respective display, a towering burst of fury illuminating the landscape around for quite some distance. You can feel the heat on your face. Enraptured now, you quickly approach, a rare sense of wonder welling up inside you.Incendia, an overhead sign reads, the Arabesque characters glowing an ominous shade of red as it keeps watch over the doorway below. Svelte burgundy ropes reminiscent of an old opera house funnel you inwards and you step inside, and are promptly greeted by a smiling woman standing at a short podium. She smiles at you, her smoky eyes lighting up at the sight of the awe on your face. 30 seconds ago, you would've considered her minimal attire quite unprotected against the crisp fall air, but now that youäó»ve crossed the threshold into Incendia, you too feel and are illuminated by the radiant glow emanating from above, and her coordinated, yet informal uniform does not seem so unreasonable. 'Welcome to Incendia', she chimes, sweeping her arm in an arc as if to present the scene. 'Feel free to roam as you wish, there's plenty to discover. If I see that you've settled in at a table, I'll bring you a menu. We serve a fine selection of ambrosial, non-alcoholic beverages, both hot and cold, and also offer some exquisite and unique light hor d'oeuvres. Let me or know if you need anything!'It's a struggle to take another step forward however, as you've not yet fully processed what you see before you. In the center of the room sits a pentagonal bar, it's five vertices oriented in line with the peripheral domes surrounding this main room. The elegance of the geometry is apparent now; each smaller dome connects to this central chamber via an arched doorway, and you can see people in each room. Some sit at tables, others stand admiring central sculptures, still others lounge amongst pillows, lazily smoking hookahs.It's then that you notice the source of the airy, yet rhythmic music that permeates Incendia. Across from the main entrance hovers an elevated perch, from which a DJ deftly intertwines exotic, smoky melodies whilst the crowds mingle below, and you give a silent nod in thanks; the music complements the mood of Incendia perfectly.You approach the bar.The bartender greets you with a smile as he strains a colorful mixture into a short glass, and tops it with a sprig of mint. His attire also seems to be carefully coordinated with the motif of Incendia. You immediately notice the bar top; it's mirrored finish reflects light perfectly, and as you hover over it you look beyond your own reflection into what may be the most unique fire effect you have ever seen. Turning now above and arching your back, you gaze at the full majesty of Incendia. 15 feet above your head swirls a ceiling of undulating, pulsing flame. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and it is absolutely spellbinding. Almost directly under center now, you experience the full force of it's radiant capability, not dissimilar to that of the equatorial sun. You've never seen flame move in this way, undulating slowly, wafting against the amorphous ceiling, which blends seamlessly into the night sky above. Further analyzing, it seems that the bulk of the flame emanates from a central point. It spurts downward sporadically, like some twisted inverse cousin of a courtyard water fountain, before dispersing in every direction in a chaotic, meandering path. You look back down to see the bartender grinning at you. He slides a box across the bar, in your direction. On it's top is a dizzying bank of switches, illuminated buttons and symbols. The bartender leans in and extending an index finger, presses a centrally-positioned red button, . Above you, the ceiling roars, and immediately you feel a wave of heat blast your face. He releases the button, and as quickly as it came, the flame dissipates. He presses more buttons, and blasts of flame shoot upwards from the peaks of the peripheral domes around you. You realize now the root of his sly grin, and eagerly begin to push buttons yourself, unleashing a cacophony of radiant bursts in and around Incendia. The bartender quickly cuts you off before you become drunk with power, and slides a colorful cocktail over in place of the omnipotent box. Turning back around to find your friends, you begin to notice the finer details of the space, which had gone unnoticed previously. Ornate lamps jut out from the arching struts of the dome, dim light flickering through their frosted panes. You count five; a number that seems to be a recurring motif in Incendia. Beneath, atop pentagonal tables, sit silver candelabras adorned with tall candles, wax dripping down languidly to meet the tablecloth below. The burgundy fabric's shimmer seems to adopt an otherworldly depth beneath the rolling glow of the fire. Silver tassel festoons the edges of the tablecloth, contrasting elegantly with the matte black floor. The benches surrounding these tables are tailored similarly, and people idle all around, propped up on tasseled cushions, sipping their respective cocktails.Your friends call to you from the entranceway of an adjoining room, beckoning you to follow. Weaving your way between the tables and benches, you make your way to the arched portal and stare in amazementäó_.Weäó»re not going to give away ALL the secrets of Incendia. You'll have to see it with your own eyes to uncover the rest. The result of countless hours spent simmering, brooding, and scheming, we are ready to make this concept a reality. No detail will be spared, and nary an eventuality has gone unconsidered._____________________________________________________________Incendia arose from humble beginnings. Its progression tells the story of a concept ever-expanding in breadth and scope.The essence of Incendia lies in a unique flame effect near it's zenith. By piping propane gas along the aluminum trusses of it's geodesic frame, and releasing it below the steel ceiling, a mesmerizing, undulating plane of fire is unleashed. It casts a warm, illuminating glow upon the inhabitants below, and provides an unparalleled ambience for gatherings large and small.ŒæThis exquisite and hypnotic effect was discovered whilst toying around one day with small gas-fed pedestals created from the bases of salvaged propane tanks. When inverted, the parabolic bowl cupped the flame and prevented it from rising into the sky; and so the concept was born. We attached one of these bowls to the peak of a geodesic dome in early 2013, and soon thereafter, the show hit the road. Featured at myriad small events and art festivals in the summer and fall of 2013, the installation evolved with each deployment. It took on a life of it's own, yet eventually no more could be added to the humble, 12' wide dome.Over the past winter, we creators brainstormed and schemed a way to go bigger. Logistical hurdles arose with an increase in scale, but we have overcome. The project also adopted a fundamental motif when lead designer Cory Glenn visited Morocco for several weeks in February. This trip directly resulted in many of the architectural elements and interior design features visible in today's most recent permutation of Incendia.The last four months have been spent tirelessly researching, designing, planning, and hammering to bring you the 20' diameter, 10' tall geodesic dome installation you see in the video above. We're nowhere near stopping in our ascension of scale, but now we need your help.ŒæOur goal is to build a total of five 20' diameter domes, and orient them radially around one mammoth, 50' diameter geodesic hemisphere, to be connected via shared archways as depicted in the model shown in the video. Each 20' diameter dome will feature a different art piece in it's center, or be available to host tables and chairs for catered events. We seek to make this comprehensive configurationŒædeployable for a wide range of events, from music festivals, art shows, and street fares, to wedding receptions, private soirees, and corporate conventions. We'll be able to host a stage, or a raised DJ booth. The bar can be relocated to a peripheral dome when hosting concerts in the center space. This August, we'll utilize the domes as shade structures replete with misting jets, at an outdoor music festival in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Incendia can truly be a dynamic, adaptive platform suitable for use in myriad different scenarios.We seek funding for Incendia in the amount of $10,000. Please help us accomplish this incredible, passion-fueled endeavor! We believe it's an installation without limit, and with your help, we can realize this incredible installation.Feel free to contact us if you'd like to see other installations designed and constructed by the creators. We've built some cool stuff. If you're interested in booking Incendia for an event outside our geographically-constrained reward area, we're very flexible and willing to go the distance!Œæ"
545," No Land, No CultureŒæA Vision of America as a Holy PlaceI am an artist, part Native American and part Scottish.  My great grandmother was full blood Cherokee.  She was Lucy Guntharp.  For the last 20 years I have painted murals.  I wasnäó»t aware of my Native heritage until I was an adult.  I was always, never the less, always interested in Native Culture.ŒæŒæAs an artist I want to create a cultural bridge between the first indigenous peoples of this land we walk on and all the rest of us who walk on it, not realizing the sacredness of this land, particular sites and the earth energy that radiates through to us.  We all stand on the same sacred earth and are manifestations of the spirit it emanates.ŒæNative peoples on this land made monuments to the sacredness of the land or landscape.  Sacred forts, rock art, circular embankments often facing a river bend or a sacred site.  A place of Spiritual practice.The Native model offers what constitutes a spiritual relationship to the Land. Seeing this model may encourage us to reflect on our own traditions and äóìcultivateäó a sense of the Scared Land or a least a sense of respect. This seems most important at a time when our earth is ecologically threatened and might also serve as a common thread to unify our diverse cultures.	In regards to these concepts: ŒæI have created the idea of an art educational collaboration or äóìCultural Bridgeäó between Non-Natives and the Native American Communities to help in the creation of äóìMural Spirit Dwellings.äó This involves the mentoring of Native and non-Native youth, as well as with the advice and help of Native elders, Artists, Museum Curators, Art collectors and others, to come up with designs, stories, history etc., to aid in a joint community effort to memorialize indigenous culture of the localappropriate land areas with various art installations. 	These äóìSpirit Dwellingsäó are sculptural and architectural, externally. On the inside there are plastered clay walls and fiber on which are painted murals and various other art works with a more traditional and earthy flavor. The design of the structures incorporate Native concepts and style put in a contemporary vein. The murals depict the history or story of the land where the äóìdwellingäó is placed. These dwellings can be both permanent for a specific location to memorialize an area and history or can be temporary and portable for display at various locations or events. The installations are large enough to walk through or sit and contemplate the art inside, but occupy a minimum of space. The dwellings are specific to that part of America and to Tribe.ŒæMy goal is to establish a formal relationship with various museums, art and education centers, corporations and organizations, to help fund this educational art project. To help in service to the community by involving young people interested in Native History and Culture as well as teaching them how to create Public Art of this magnitude and legitimacy. The various trades and art skills necessary to accomplish the project would involve: concept, design, drawing, painting, airbrushing, plastering, ceramics, fabrication and installation.This project of course would be done with the approval, involvement, respect and consultation of the Native Community.	As a final result of this awareness of our spiritual attachment to the Land it would not be to far a stretch to imagine a Green Haven, particularly on the Reservations, were Technology could meet with Tradition with Œæa respect for the land to create: clean energy, housing, medicine, farming, food resources and even economy, with an emphasis on what would be best for Mother Earth."

549," My plan is to create an artwork installation. My vision is to transform the perception of space, by filling the space occupied by the air between my mattress and my duvet, with me, asleep.The artwork itself will be represented in a black and white digital photo for all to see. In order for this artwork to be possible, I have calculated a small initial outlay will be required. This will likely be spent on a relaxing meal out for my wife and I to ""destress"". If I go over my target, additional money will be invested into additional relaxing experiences, as well as entertainment for my baby in the hope that he will sleep for long enough for me to successfully complete my composition of this installation."

551," Œæ'The Journey' is a BIG BLUE QUESTION MARK which will appear in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh for the Fringe Festival. Everyone who wants to join in writes on a small wooden house the answer to the questions 'Where do you come from? What do you think of as home? Where are your roots? Then you can walk, dance, run along the question mark until you get to the end of your journey. Then you write something about your life which you can share with others. Over 5,000 people took part in my last project: 'The Big Book' and sharing ideas with so many people is amazing. What answers will this project bring? We want it to be free for everyone, so I just need a little support to take it to the Festival. The costs are simple - transport, materials, equipment & publicity. All contributions however small are welcome."
557," As you walk up to the project a since of what awaits is clear, the fence that surrounds the installation has been made out of riffles, guns, and grenades.The Single gate that leads into the installation is itself made out of metal salvaged from weapons that were melted down.The wordsŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ ""Why do we kill in the name of...""Within awaits a grave yard of guns and Bomb, and what start to become clear is that the decommissioned bombs are covered and filled with the pictures and names, and are laid out in the shape of a large question mark.There are 196 empty bombs, one for every country and territory in the world, and everyone of them has been filled and covered by having people from around the world send in names and photos of loved ones that have been lost to violence.My goal for this project is to hopefully help to end violence, by showing not just the faces and names of those that have be lost because of it, but also the number of people that have been lost to violence, this is a memorial to Humanity, rather then a war monument. I want to people see that violence hurts everyone equally, and that we do not have a chance to create a better world unless we unite and stop trying to solve our differences through violence and aggression, but rather to embrace those differences with acceptance, and to celebrate the beauty of life, celebrate that we are different, and to live in a world where those difference are used to grow and not to destroy.It is my hope that this will be one of the most successful if not the first international art project, with people from around the world contributing their photos, names, and stories for us all to see and share, something that we can all call ours.The reason that I have chosen Berlin, Germany as the first location of the installation is that I feel that it is a great example of a place that has been shaped by war, violence, and the efforts to overcome the difference that once separated not only a country but neighbors, friends, and even family.I want the installation to be in a place where the message will is back lit with historical significance, to help emphasis the importance of the meaning behind it.I thank everyone that takes interest in my project, and who helps me to be able to make this dream of mine a reality."

559," I would like to open my own salon, but life has taught me to take baby steps & to attend to every detail when it comes to things that really matter to me. ŒæSince I can remember, art and painting in particular have been passions of mine. I've done nails for fun for over a decade, and for the last two years I've worked from home as my own apprentice, taking customers in the hopes of saving up for nail tech certification classes. As a young woman and recent college graduate, I understand the power of a nice manicure, because the nice humyn who compliments your claws can sometimes be the one who recommends you for the job, or who gives you the extra boost of confidence you need to land it yourself. I serve everyone without judgement - kings, queens, ladies, gents, little ones, and even grandma and grandpa. ŒæI love what I do, and I'm good at it. ŒæThis project is centered around showing off what I have to offer artistically, so all I'm asking for is: funding for supplies (I'm starting with nothing but my talent and 2 hands here), and shipping. ŒæThrough these custom press-ons I hope to show - rather than simply tell - those who believe in me that they are investing in something bigger. All proceeds from initial sales will go first towards backer rewards, and then towards my certification and salon. The nail business is booming, and so are my designs. ŒæDon't miss out!"
560," Trendy stores come and go .

561," Note: The controller in this video was only for test purposes and is not the final product. Final look of the controller is smaller, easier to setup, and better contained. It's also weather proof.As the thousands of people who attend music festivals like Bass Coast and Shambhala will tell you, there's something magical about the festival experience. There's this really interesting culture and an atmosphere that just seems to appear out of thing air. This art project was, in part, my way of wanting to give back and add to that incredible experience.I wanted this installation to be immersive - something you want to pause for a moment to really take in. Each mushroom independently runs it's own function to determine the fade effect every time it lights up. This causes the mushroom field to dance and flicker with life. You think you start to see a pattern, order in the chaos, but it's just a trick of the mind.The installation was designed to be modular. This is for two reasons. A modular installation allows versatility - it can be installed spread out along a pathway, or bunched together in one large field. But the modular design was also one though about with YOU in mind! We wanted to give Kickstarter backers the chance to keep a piece of the installation for your very own. We think it's a pretty cool idea and we hope you'd like to take home a patch of your own.Each patch consists of 32 mushrooms, connecting wire, and a controller that runs off a 6V lantern battery, or a wall plug power adapter. How you power your patch is ultimately up to you. We recommend planting them somewhere earthy - somewhere you won't have to mow over. Lawn-mowing your mushrooms is not generally recommended...If you don't want to keep a patch and you just want to donate we greatly appreciate your support. We hope to see you at Tall Tree, Bass Coast, and any other festivals we happen to line up last-minute this season.ŒæStay safe and happy festivaling."
562," In Boulder, Colorado a group of visionary spirits have come together with a collective mission: The Temple Project, artful space for all to enjoy. Our current expression, The Lotus Temple, is a sacred geometric structure, a gentle sanctuary made of sticks, silks and string. Six white silk Lotus domes surround a crowning shade structure, featuring a 70' handwoven dream catcher. Portable, lightweight andŒæballistic, theŒæLotus Temple is designed to be a safe retreat from any storm. ŒæThe Lotus Temple is a space to find the peaceful place inside yourself. A place to play, to dance, to learn, and to dream. A place to share your gifts and experience the gifts of others. A place to grow, a place to love, and a place to be.ŒæWe've been hard at work sowing the seeds for The Temple Project, and now we're asking for your help. We intend to bring our Lotus Temple on the road to share our creation with the world. We seek to build temples at festivals, farmer's markets, schools, and in public parks. We hope to provide opportunities for all to share inŒætheŒæjoy that The Temple Project hasŒæbrought to us.ŒæWhat we need:First, we need a trailer for transportation. We wantŒætoŒæmake The Temple Project mobile and universal. We're thinking a 12' by 6' trailer will be sufficient. We anticipate this cost at around $2,500.Next, we need some new material to improve our structure and make it weather proof. The Lotus Temple, as it stands today, uses aerial silk as its shell and is built right on the earth. While the silk is beautiful, it is not protective during inclement weather, and while we love getting down in the dirt, we want to be able to host outdoor yoga on any terrain. We'll need about $2,000 for waterproof fabric for our architect Sai to sew into bright white temple shells, and another $2000 to build a portable and solid bamboo flooring system to keep things light and comfortable, anywhere we go.ŒæWe'd like to illuminate the temple at night. We're looking for solar powered LED lights. We hope to keep this cost under $2,000.ŒæWe're looking forward to a season of sharing the temple at local and international transformational festivals, so we're going to need some new shocks for our vanimal, gas money, and organic veggies for our crew. We'd like to be able to share this space with as many hearts as possible. That means building The Lotus Temple at Sonic Bloom in Southpark, Co. Then we'll be traveling to British Columbia to build sacred space at Luminosity Gathering and Bass Coast Festival, where our temple will be used for meditation, movement, workshop space and renegade sound healing. After that we'll be high tailing it back to Colorado to build with our family and friends at Arise Festival at Sunrise Ranch Retreat Center in Loveland, CO. After Arise we'll head west toward Black Rock City, with ambitions of creating the ultimate oasis at Burning Man: The Water Temple; a steam shower for meditation, hygiene and relaxation, a place to recognize the principles behind our resources and to pay homage to the Earth's most precious gift to us, water. We plan to allot around $3,000 to travel expenses for our team.ŒæWe'd like to build a custom sound system. We will utilize the remainder ofŒæfunding to create a 360 degree sound seal within the temple. Sound therapy is a tool for meditation as well as movement. We host workshop presenters, musicians, and healers as a venue for healing transformation through sound. We will incorporate evolving technology with our architect Sai's mandalic designs, for an all original top-tier Templar sound experience. We anticipate a cost of around $5,000 for our custom sound system.ŒæEvery little bit helps, offer a gift for everyone to share. We dedicate this temple for the benefit of all beings.ŒæWhat do you get?no two are the same.ŒæArtifacts of the future, transcending the game.ŒæA token of chance, and meant to be shared, in universal ascension not one will be spared.ŒæAcknowledge potential of your unique hue, unlock your own temple, the magic is true.ŒæThe equation is simple, a connection to source, here to remind you of your infinite force.Primordial patterns carved into wood, conducting knowledge and power in all that is good.ŒæGeometric in nature, as wearable art, a figurative bridge from solar plexus to heart.ŒæLet fate lead your way, may the stars be a sign that in love and with gratitude,Œæit is time to align.ŒæAn original Galactic Key, laser cut from repurposed mandala wood.

563," My work as a practice examines the privileged myths and images of our Australian society and their treatment in contemporary society. In this particular installation, I discuss the implications of Virtual Reality as a means to commodify public spaces for mass consumption for the almost religious space of the Australian Beach that has so far resisted Capitalist assimilation. With Virtual Reality, there is a potential to create idealistically superior beaches that subsume their natural counter-parts that I suggest by juxtaposing this film of water with the physical sand it is projected onto.Your pledged money will go towards the purchase of two high quality projectors (about $5,000 each), their mounts, and renting an exhibition space for two or three weeks.Œæ Ideally, I am looking to hire a space at the Brand X space at Central Park (about $1,200 a week) so that the installation can not only be a provocative socio-political polemic but also an enjoyable place to bring the creative community of Sydney together for a good time!

775," Based on a true story about a man in mental health recovery looking back on his life of abuse & neglect while finding his place in life, the film is told in poetry, music and narration and not only looks at the life of Mike Corey but will also look on topics such as (Stigma on all sides, The fear and joy of recovery, The Judgments people have of mental illness and the Judgments those with MI have of others and much more)Five years ago Mike Corey began writing his album ""Darkness & Light "" based on the events of his own life. From abandonment by his family as a young boy, Living on the streets as a teen slipping through the cracks of the system, while living with mental illness and using street drugs as a way to escape his reality but then finding his way off the drugs & streets and finding people along the way to take him in and show him the love,compassion and beauty and the escape that is music.... but then in his 20's he suffered a mental breakdown and became a total recluse for 9 straight years but was finally forced to come out and to look at his past, finding a love within all the madness that had always been there and finally reaching out for professional help to begin the process of healing from the past and learning of his and his family's mental differences......ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ ^:Mike Corey's - Mind So Broken^As Mike continued his journey toward healing and living a life he loved and always wanted a few things came about and people started to really enjoy his writing and voice,as he was promoting his album via Facebook as can be seen in his official greeting ......Thanks for the friendship I'm a singer song writer.

After the experience in the B-film industry Mike and Lenny decided they wanted to make a film themselves...but what were they going to make? ideas were being talked about for a year or so while Mike was recording his solo album.Just him,his guitar and his own words from the heart,during that time it came to Mike to make a film based on his life and his album told in poetry and song showing the healing process and coming to terms with his own mental issues.... Mike then called up Lenny and they began to work on a video Mike asked his son Dakota Corey to play his teenage self and his step daughter Amethyst Love ""who has worked at the local independent film company Plastic Age Productions since the age of 5"" if she would like to play off screen parts, she humbly agreed (provided she got an on screen part at some time as well). Mike and Lenny began to record and edit the film but soon realized that they did not have the equipment to do what they were striving for and did not have the funds to finish the project. So they did what they could with what they had. MIke asked Lenny to overlay some guitar work on the poetry making the short film a bit smoother and after working for about 60 hours they had the promo video to help raise money. Mike then asked me Angela Lingelbach ""who has helped support his projects for the last 5 years"" if i would help him raise the money for this project. so here we are :)""At this point most everyone listed below are doing multiple tasks in the film and most are doing it for food, the love of the story and the love of independent art""Mike CoreyAngela LingelbachSam McpeakDakota Corey Lenny CowartTracey Schock Cody DuSavageJim Wooldridge And one of the State lines finest Stephen F.

776," WHAT AM I DOING - The goal here on KickStarter is to raise the money necessary to reproduce my black and white illustrations on regulatory speed limit signs just like those speed limit signs found along U.S. city streets. The äóìSpeed Limit Collection - 001äó signs produced will be a limited edition run, where each sign manufactured will be signed, and numbered by myself the artist.WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU  - By supporting me and pledging to my project I am opening up the first signs of the limited edition run, to be purchased through this KickStarter campaign. This means you will receive a unique speed limit sign, or signs depending upon your pledge level, allowing the KickStarter supporter to have received their sign/signs at a lower pre-order price before the remaining signs are officially released. I have also created lower pledge levels where KickStarter supporters can get the cool illustrations either as a postcard or 18äóx24äó print. Finally for those that want something completely original I will hand paintŒæan original black enamel painting of the vehicle of your choice, on a 18""x24"" U.S. regulatory speed limit sign.ABOUT THE SIGNS - All of the signs produced in this limited edition run, will be screen printed on .080 aluminum, with an engineer grade reflective surface. The signs will be cut, rounded, and drilled to U.S. 18äóx24äó regulatory speed limits sign specifications, and will be produced by a shop experienced in producing DOT approved regulatory street signs. Each sign will be inspected by myself and will be signed and numbered.

777," Hi.  My name is OJ Dawoodi (not to be confused with the other OJ äóñ I get that a lot).  I have been a DJ since 1983.  Iäó»ve also have been drawing, painting or coloring since I remember.  For the last 3 decades, Iäó»ve been playing music on vinyl records to entertain the masses.  As time has passed and technology has changed the DJ game, I have been fortunate enough to be able to continue using vinyl to play my music by way of software and hardware from Serato Scratch LIVE.  This system allows me (and thousands of other DJs) to store all the music on a laptop and still use records that have a digital timecode to control those songs via the hardware.  Hereäó»s what it looks like:What this has done is turned the once warm, wonderful medium into a cold, calculating mistress.  This saddens a lot of us music lovers.  My projectäó»s goal is to rescue some of these pieces of vinyl from the fate of playing a digital tone for the rest of their lives and turn them into something that has love and warmth imbibed back into them.Œæ To accomplish this, I'm asking for your help.Œæ In return, you can get some of my work sent to you.Œæ Also, the pledge amounts will go towards funding future projects along the same lines.Œæ I thank you VERY much for reading.Œæ For your viewing pleasure, my humble dining room... err... I mean, studio!Œæ  Here is where the magic happens:The projectsäó_IT'S MUSIC TIMEBy taking a record and turning it into a clock, I would like to give a home and purpose to a rescued piece of vinyl.  All clocks will be hand-cut, shaped and assembled from a black Scratch LIVE control record. They will come beautifully mounted on a desktop stand and will have an optional wall-mount hook on the back.Œæ The clock face measures 6"" x 8"" and it runs on one AA battery.WILD ABOUT MUSICFor this part of the project, I take a clear (translucent) control record and hand-paint one of four animal print designs on the back side in reverse order.  The result: the front side will show a really neat design that can be either played on a Scratch LIVE compatible DJ setup or hung up and displayed.  Places like Michaeläó»s craft supply or Aaron Brothers sell shadow box frames for displaying 12äó LPs that these look amazing in.  Use your own creativity to display these rescued records.  There are 4 designs that I have settled on to choose from.  Keep in mind that the following pictures include mockups and each of the hand-painted designs will look slightly different.OK.Œæ That's pretty much it.Œæ If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me.Œæ You can reach me on my facebook page http://facebook.com/djoj1, on twitter at http://twitter.com/djoj or by email at djojone@gmail.com.Thank you for looking and thank you VERY MUCH in advance for your support.Œæ I look forward to thanking you all personally."

782," The primary mission of the Tsunami Bass Experience is to promote and facilitate proper Bass Culture appreciation by and for the creators, producers, performers and wobble rousing lovers of low end frequency music while also introducing the uninitiated to an innovative experience in bass culture via our interactive sound installation called the TBE ~WaVe~ 2.0.ŒæHelp us build The Wave, a dance floor that vibrates! People dancing on the Wave literally feel music from head to toe as they hear it on our high-end 20,000+ watt sound system. The bass-heavy dance music performed by our international roster of DJ producers and musicians is specially chosen to maximize the effects of the entire system. The audio system and dance floor are complemented by a light and video show projected on a screen shaped like a crashing tidal wave, providing a one-of-kind immersive audio, visual andŒækinestheticŒæexperience.ŒæFirst conceived in 2008 at Burning Man, TBE co-founders and co-producers ShiZaru.zoe and Andrew Morphous have been collaborating ever since and at last debuted the first ~WaVe~ prototype at the Funhause Technology Fair in Dumbo BK in early 2011.ŒæNext, after several underground event applications to further our research and development, the 2011 ~WaVe~1.0 continued to grow and appeared at a number of freeBASSin' events throughout 2011. Our gift to all, showcasing multiple, ever so gifted line-ups of the finest local, national and international bass culture talent available to us, at many free events such as Figment NYC 2011 where we hosted a 3 day line up...Œæ... under taking a mobile version of the ~WaVe~ inside a rental truck at the Lost Horizon Night Market in Brooklyn NY in May, 2011...Œæ... and even holding freeBASSin' events in public spaces such as at McCarren Park for all to wobble out in Tsunami Bass Experience style!Our debut year culminated the year with a determined large scale Burning Man 2011 debut (at the BRC CAMPus of the TBE Multiversity of Bass Culture Appreciation at 10&Graduation), providing an entire week of proper bass culture appreciation by and for the denizens of Black Rock City.ŒæThe previous budgets for the first four years of the TBE~WaVe~ project, as well as the Tsunami Bass Sound System (usage donated for free via MorphSaru Corp) used in conjunction with the ~WaVe~ has beenŒæcompletelyŒæself-funded by its creators, co-founders ShiZaru.zoe and Andrew Morphous.ŒæThe TBE ~WaVe~ is our gift to the various groups in which we actively participate in collaboration with many like-minded colleges and fellow artists from the local, national and international Bass communities, as well as the international Burner community, we have showcased and featured many artists from both worlds at every TBE ~WaVe~ event whether we are freeBASSin' or fundBASSin'.ŒæThe Tsunami Bass Experience consistently sought to provide an inclusionary and interactive experience that has the potential to change both internal and external perceptions of an oft misaligned, misunderstood genre of music we know as Bass Culture. While our few attempts at fundraising in the summer of 2011 fell short of yielding more than great vibes, good times and lots of R&D opportunities to perfect our design, everyŒæappearanceŒæof the ~WaVe~ in 2011 was extremely well received and we have been consistently encouraged by so many to continue and expand our efforts. Well into our forth year of this legacy that we have built ourselves, proven we have learned and experienced what it takes to execute, in several locations and we are now reaching out to our various communities for a little support to enable the 2012 TBE ~WaVe~ 2.0 to be more fiscally viable for the Tsunami Bass Experience collective.ŒæHOW WILL THE MONEY RAISED BE USED by TBE?All funds raised by this 2012 Kickstarter campaign will goŒæsolelyŒæto pay for the materials required to build, equipment needed to run, transportation to deliver, this campaign (fees), and power generation costs associated with executing multipleŒæappearancesŒæof the ~WaVe~ 2.0 during 2012 and beyond including, but not limited to; Figment NYC (June 9th) , Transformus, Burning Man, and various local area free and fundBASSin' events. It does not pay for any personal expenses, producer, performer or artist fees, or any other such costs.ŒæA breakdown of expenses this fund will cover include the following:ŒæMaterial costs include high qualityŒæecologically obtainedŒælumber, proper treatment/sealant, and fittings for production of eight new dance platforms constructed to enable a long lasting mobile installation for indoor/outdoor day/night usage for the year.ŒæExperimentingŒæwith various materials we have developed and designed upgraded platforms that will replace the worn prototypes from 2011. The new platforms constructed for use in the 2012 ~WaVe~2.0 will be used throughout 2012 are designed to transition into our next generation framing planned for 2013, and as such, consecutively utilized. Sculpture material costs, although reduced by recycling of the 2011 ~WaVe~ PVC piping, fabric, reinforcements, rebar and lights from the 2011 ~WaVe~1.0 are recycled, so the 2.0 upgrade only requires half the additional materials be acquired. Equipment costs include a few new transducers and amps and the remaining budget will be used to cover the ~WaVe~ 2.0 transportation (truck, gas) and generator rentals/fuel costs.ŒæWhile we are ""burners,"" the ~WaVe~2.0 for 2012 is not a project that will be burned. As in previous years, materials and equipment obtained and used in festivals during 2012 will be reused and recycled for multiple future appearances of the ~WaVe~ in coming years, thereby reducing future costs and leaving less trace. The only trace our installation leaves is the afterglow of fine low frequency vibes and an enhanced perception of bass culture and resulting edutainment and how it can be appreciated. ŒæWe hope you will back us by pledging any amount or purchasing either a small or large reward. And do come enjoy the fruits of our labor at any event we have!! Support & be supported by the Tsunami Bass Experience ~WaVe~ 2.0 and we hope to see you wobbling out with us at one of our manyŒæappearancesŒæin 2012 and beyond.

In some events, this is further enhanced by visuals yielding a a multi-sensory, perception changing conditions under which the designated '~WaVe~ worthy"" bass culture music the bass masters wield can best be appreciated.

It is herŒæimpassionedŒælost poster that inspires our soon to be released screen print.For a while now I have wanted to do another custom bike. I've done fabric wrapped, knitted, decoupage, and custom paint. Then my bike got stolen! This is my vehicle and someone cut through its chain and left no trace of my trusty bicycle.THE OFFERSo I am offering participation in the process of getting a new bike in trade for little kickbacks and some lucky backer, or two, will have a custom bike in the end.This is an example of a finish that I will offer. May not be exact as we all have varying techniques, but I do love the effect!!Or perhaps you have a favorite comic or work of literature that you want to streak around town on.ŒæThis is another fun example, but I don't recommend this in Seattle or any mostly rainy city, better in dry climates and indoor storage, since I cannot waterproof the yarns.SO I am excited.

785," As a ten-year-old boy playing cowboys with friends at school in England, I was never allowed to be a cowboy; I could only be a Native American Indian.ŒæI was told: ""Black boys were never cowboys"" or ""Have you ever seen a black cowboy?"" I had to admit that I had never seen a single black cowboy.ŒæThe only cowboys we ever saw were your white archetypal squared-jawed, American gun-slinging heroes.Œæ Think of our screen legends; The Lone Ranger, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Roy Rogers, Clint Eastwood, right up to The Marlboro Man, the list is endless.Œæ Not one black cowboy amongst them.ŒæIndeed Hollywood played a big part in keeping the cowboy myth alive.Œæ In fact where American history and identity has been projected by Hollywood and the mass media, the non-white settlers have largely been left out of the story.ŒæThirty years later and enjoying watching those same legends with my own children, I have only just learnt the truth; many of the first cowboys were black.ŒæI have now made it my metier to discover these forgotten cowboys. And I have been both surprised and excited to find a thriving African American cowboy community.The original term 'cowboy' was a derogatory slight against the black man often born into slavery. The terms house boy, field boy, kitchen boy and 'cow boy' were commonly used. Ironically, because of the abilities of these early stock handlers, the term became associated with strength, skill and tough, manly ruggedness.After the American civil war many black cowboys and former plantation slaves enlisted in the army cavalry and were known as Buffalo Soldiers.Once they left the military they stayed in the Western territories and became ranch hands orŒæcowboys.ŒæNon-military black men simply went West, seeking a better life, signed on with ranches and learned on the job.Œæ TheyŒæwere often brilliant horseman orŒæsharp shooters,Œæand many went on to become ranch foremen and managers, while others were hired asŒæguides orŒæfederal peace officers in the Indian territories. It is estimated that as many a a third of all cowboys contracted to drive cattle to markets across America were either black,ŒæIndianŒæor Mexican. ŒæAs well as the physically hard lifestyle, African American cowboys, often had to endure discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice. To counter this they learnt to excel at their work. They were most often the best at roping, bronco busting, taming mustangs, calling the brands, controlling the herd, or topping off horses.ŒæI hope to document the lives of the men women and children who compete in the hundreds of rodeo events across the country. Shockingly many black cowboys from communities across the US were banned from competing at the main rodeos right until the late 1980's.ŒæEven with that hardship I have found that black cowboys were fundamental to the evolution of the western narrative, which has been so central to the identity of mainstream or ""White America"". Œæ Œæ ŒæWhen I came across this community of black cowboys recently in TexasŒæ it surprised me how little I knew and also how little was known about these true pioneers of the Wild West.ŒæFor too long now, the contributions of the African-American cowboy has been overlooked and almost forgotten in the great history of the American West.ŒæI would like to recognize these unsung heroes.My aim is to produce a multimedia exhibition, which will consist of one full length documentary feature film, three short video stories, a photographic portrait series and a photographic book, all under the title of 'The Forgotten Cowboy'.My responsibility as a documentarian photographer/filmmaker is to translate what I see and to produce an objective project, which enlightens, entertains, stirs emotion, educates, and hopefully leaves an indelible impression.ŒæŒæAnd as a visual artist I have a keen curiosity in every new story that comes my way.Crew, equipment rental, travel/transportation, & post production make up a majority of the costs. We are now trying to reach our desired goal of $50,000 endeavoring to make the best multimedia exhibition possible.This is a creavtie project, and the current funding goal reflects the estimated cost of putting together an independent multi-media project.I would like to thank Kickstarter and everyone who has expressed an interest in this project."

787," The Art of Flatlining is a 48"" long by 4"" tall accordion artist book letterpress printed on black Canson heavyweight paper hand-made by Bay Area / Berlin-based book artist Mirabelle Jones. Front and back cover are board covered in silver artist paper featuring title and colophon. When the book is opened, with pages turned individually in codex format or opened simultaneously as an accordion, sub and super-audible frequencies recorded onto MP3 sound chips resound at both the lows and highs of human hearing. The paper is accented by a pressure print of translucent crisscrossing lines, a visualization of disembodied cacophony. A slender broken line is printed in silver ink across the length of the book made of leads hand set and hand cut by the artist. These breaks in the line map the peaks and valleys of pitfalls and triumphs in the life of the artist over a 6 month period of time, offering an imaginary EKG for the reader to complete. Across the top and bottom of each page is a short, quizzical, at times comical, at times jarring description of the artist's polar experiences, with a dark absence marking an unnameable event. Your contribution to the project will allow this edition of 50 books to be completed through the purchase of 200 sound cards, 50 sheets of paper, and 4 pieces of board. Thank you for promoting emerging artists.Œæ Mirabelle Jones is the founder of Art Against Assault: An artist's collective seeking to grant voice to survivors of rape and sexual assault as well as raise public awareness and encourage discourse through artistic means. 10% of all proceeds gained through the sales of ""The Art of Flatlining"" will go to charitable organizations RAINN.org and BAWAR.org.

It's been a very difficult task to find the right combination ofŒætechnical equipment and expertise to capture the original detail on the reproduction. We wanted to give the reproductions the 3-dimensional feel of the originals. With several years of trial and error and several very expensive pieces of equipment, we have finally mastered duplication of the detailed scratchboard. Now we are ready to produce master quality limited edition scratchboard art!Scratchboard is a very uncommon media to create fine art with. Scratchboard is artist board that is coated with a fine museum quality white clay, then coated with blackŒæIndia ink. You must be precise as it is very easy to scratch through the thin layer of clay rendering the entire piece ruined! Heather spends painstaking amounts of time to scratch each tiny detail into the scratchboard by hand. After she creates the lifelike 3Œædimensional image into the scratchboard, she masterfully colors the piece with ink to give it that warmth and depth!Heather is a master of her craft. She has wonŒænumerousŒæawards including best in show and division awards. She is currently contracting to hang in several high level galleries and is becoming a huge success. We need to cover our initial production costs and want to share Heather Lara's work with everyone at Kickstarter before her hugeŒædebut!"
790," This is why I am asking you to fund the first project to take awesome photos of ""Beauty in Blue"" The reason for destroying this art(that has cost a great deal of money and time to make) is to show that lettinggo is ultimately the toughest and sometimes the most rewarding thing of all.Please do not get me wrong; this was not a simple decision or some way just toget famous. Having tried hundreds of ideas to get famous as an artist I am nowcontent just making better art. When taking the picture of ""Beauty in BlueSunset"" with Photographer Manny Vargas gave me theŒærealizationthat many pictures all over the world in different settings can make the artbetter and the destruction will make it the epitome of performance art.Thank you Penn Jillette from Penns sunday school podcast (a brilliantshow by the way) for giving me the seed to make Destroy Beauty a wonderfulthing.

This event is under constant assault form the outside commercialization that pervades the East End of Long Island during the Summer.Traditionally, the cost of this event is borne entirely by the artists themselves and a few local supporters. This year, we are reaching out to the art-loving public to make this event bigger and better than ever!"
792," We are a photography company in Northeast Florida. We cover everything from sporting events, live music, modeling, birthdays, parties, and weddings. The goal for our project is to bring the people of Jacksonville a source to know exactly what is going on in their city, provide complete coverage of events, and do it from a stand point of a fellow citizen who is not looking for fame or the perks that come from that. The money raised through Kickstarter will go to web development, sponsorships, and production of print materials."
793," I am honored that I have been offered an artist residency atthe Imagine Gallery in Beijing, China for March 2013.Œæ I am lookingforward to this wonderful opportunity.Œæ Unfortunately, there is no funding attached to thisresidency.Œæ I truly appreciate your taking the time to visit my kickstarterpage to see what my artist residency is all about.Œæ It would mean so much to me if you couldpledge your support of my residency. My plan is to continue to develop my current body of work using China and mytravels as inspiration and a source for found objects.Œæ The body of work isentitled ""Archeological Remnants"" and it combines traditional andmodern quilting techniques, found objects, and rust dyed fabrics that cometogether to represent what we as a society have left behind, forgotten, butwill again discover through excavation. The pieces will consist of large and small scale mixed-media quilted wallpieces, three-dimensional mixed-media sculptures, and altered books. ŒæThepieces will reflect an interest in three types of materials: found objects thathave been discarded, photographs (altered and raw), and various types of dyedmaterials.Œæ My interest in this concept began several years ago after our house wasbuilt.Œæ As I would walk around the property I discovered bits and piecesof the former life of the land (farm land) and the remnants of the build.ŒæIt was as if the earth was revealing these artifacts so they may be discoveredand reused.Œæ Rusted barbed wire embedded deep within the bark of trees,bits of metal from discarded farm equipment, fragments of ceramics, and anassortment of interesting construction debris.Please visit my website: www.rebeccaaranyi.comto see some of my current as archived works.

794," Acouple years ago, I made a set of jewelry based upon the Grimmäó»s FairyTales. This Kickstarter project will enable me to complete a similar set ofwork based on the Panchatantra, a collection of Indian folk tales.a case displaying some of my pins based on Grimm's Fairy TalesAlthough Iäó»ve read the Panchatantra, I need tocarefully reread it. And as I read each story, Iäó»ll be waiting for a visualrepresentation to spring into my mind. As soon as this happens, Iäó»ll make arough sketch on my iPad. It will look something like this:Œæthis is a rough sketch I made while reading Grimm's Rose RedSome time after making the sketch, I will transfer it to my laptop and render the image into very tight design like this:mockup for Rose RedIn order to translate my design into a real-world object, I have to create a schematic for how it will be built. Because I work with sheets of anodized aluminum, I need to create plans for how to build up layers to achieve the final image. Therefore, I render templates like this:templates I made for assembling the Rose Red design into a pin or tinAfter creating the templates, I'm ready to begin the process of creating the final pieces of art. You can see all these steps documented here. For the example above, I wound up with a pin/brooch, a keepsake tin, and a pair of earrings:Rose Red PinRose Red TinRose Red EarringsI'm afraid I got a bit ahead of myself in the previous section. While I fully intend to turn the stories of the Panchatantra into the type of art described above, it is this Kickstarter project that will enable me to embark upon that process.So here is what I intend to do: It will costŒæ $2,834.79 to complete the work described above. Please see this budget which details how I intend to spend the money you provide to support this project. I am truly grateful for your contributions, but I also want you to feel that the money you give is being used appropriately. And, if I am so lucky to be funded over my budget amount, I will use the excess for updates to my workshop, thus allowing me to purchase new equipment to better complete the project (I sure would like a laser cutter...).I believe I have created some great rewards for this Kickstarter project. I tried to include a little of something for everyone and I do hope you find one that's just right for you (or someone you love).Please note, all rewards include free shipping to anywhere in the United States. I will charge actual shipping costs for international supporters. The dates given for the delivery of the rewards are based upon the assumption that I receive my goal for support of this project. Because the rewards are all hand-made, if I receive support above my goal, it will take me additional time to complete production of the rewards. I will, however, provide regular updates on the progress I make on the project.Also, as an extra-special bonus, I'd love for someone to have my Grimm Pins series that started this whole adventure. It is a set of sixty pins stored in three attractive glass-topped wooden cases. Three of the pins are actually miniature books I made by hand. You can learn more about this work here. And I'd be absolutely thrilled to send this work to a supporter for a pledge of $1,000 or more. "

This juxtaposition of contented bliss with primal yearning encourages a personal exploration that extends beyond the veneer of everyday ritual, right to the frontier of the private spiritual sphere. The Production: In an intimate setting, limited to 50 guests per showing, Marie, in Eve persona, guides participants through a Sacred Experience with an orated, riveting narrative of beauty and desire.Œæ The narrative is complemented by an exploration of: sight-sound synergies through electrifying time-lapse videography and scintillating interior designs; the taste-sense spectrum through an edible elements offering; and corporeal form illuminations through stunning body art and captured dance movement.Œæ For each 90-minute experience date, ambiance and costumes will showcase one of the nine Genesis Creation-Temptation phases: from The Beginning through The Fall.ŒæŒæ Highlighting the Radiance369 ""looks"" for Eve are custom-made halos that symbolize each period of creation.""In heaven, how do you envision your HALO?Œæ I plan to have 9.Œæ Here's one of them, representingŒæ Creation Day-Age 6:Œæ Eve's wedding :)!""The $$$: The project has a budgeted base need of $35,000 to execute seven to nine glorious performances this year.Œæ Since January 2012, $10,000 has been invested by its producer, with incomparable investments of TIME and TALENT by the stellar Radiance369 Artists.Œæ The remaining $25,000 raised via your help will be used to offset current equipment and supplies investments; and to purchase projection equipment, additional set materials, graphic design, website development, performance staffing, venue rental, general marketing, and limited production/distribution of a Radiance369 DVD and color catalog that includes the full literary novella of Creation and Temptation through the eyes of Eve.Œæ All $$ raised above the target amount will be faithfully used for additional performances and artist development.The Status: The project is 50% complete and will launch with private VIP screenings in early August.Œæ The general public will be invited to engage in A Sacred Experience in Fall 2012.Œæ Visit our Facebook page for more behind-the-scenes detail, photos, updates, and to meet the team.

Inside the BioBus -- a converted, carbon-neutral 1974 city bus -- anyone can use some of the world's most powerful microscopes to search out the beauty, mystery, and horror of an unfamiliar world.The BioBus has been accepted to FIGMENT Arts Festival in NYC, but needs your help to get there. The BioBus will set up for FIGMENT on Governors Island on Saturday, June 9th and Sunday, June 10th, inviting thousands aboard for a chance to find artistic inspiration in the unfamiliar aesthetic of the microscopic world. Visitors will work hand-in-hand with a staff of five professional scientists who will help people explore the spiky hairs on the wing of a fly, or pollen grains that look like metallic soccer balls from outer space, or the fluorescent glowing insides of a plant cell.

They are also, to the most part, within scale with each other. As well as creating these individual character prints, there aims to be a set of different sized posters that will focus on different groups such as the  Autobots, Deceptions and teams like the Constructions. Also posters that will be unique to certain backers of the project.ŒæThe final aim is to be able to create one long poster that will contain all of the created pixel transformers as a one off print. the poster will probably be sold through my website once its done.Stretch goals:After making the characters and printing off the prints, a personal aim is to ultimately animate each one to transform into their vehicles. I havenäó»t got a plan for what I want to do with them as of yet but at the moment their just going to be design for personal use unless there is an interest in them. already got one or two animated as of the start of this kickstarter run.Œæ"
816," Hello!My name is John Schlegel and I love to draw and create art. I am so excited for the opportunity to take my art to the next level. With the pledge donations, I will purchase a laptop and Adobe Illustrator, and spend my Summer mastering this program so I can turn my drawings into graphic images. While I realize this is no easy task, my dedication and desire to see this through will be unmistakable. By August I will have achieved some success with this program and send pledges some awesome stickers.ŒæI have created many drawings for businesses, friends, and labels but have been diasspointed and frsutrated every time I need to hire another artist to make my images come to print. The ability to design and create my own digital images is a dream that I hope to make reality.ŒæWith every pledge I become closer to this goal. I also hope this experience will bring me into contact with other artists and  parties interested in my work. Here are some examples of drawings I have done.Œæ"
817," Drawing is my passion but I want to expand my portfolio to include paintings! Now if only there was a way to afford painting supplies.. my ultimate goal is to become a tattoo artist but as of right now my portfolio is limited. Showing a wide variety of skills will increase the chance of becoming an apprentice to a skilled tattoo artist so that I can learn how to tattoo the right way. Plus I've always had the desire to paint but looking at painting supplies, particularly oil, is shocking to see the prices. So fund me on my adventure towards the career I've always dreamed of! Thank you for even looking, that much is very much appreciated.Below are the prints/originals you may choose from:"
818," I (David Morales) am currently an inmate in the Colorado Department of Corrections and would like to create an online Gallery to share my artwork with the outside world.Œæ Over the course of my incarceration I discovered a talent and passion for creating artwork. This started as a way to pass the time and evolved into something more.Œæ It's therapeutic values assisted in my rehabilitation and taught me many valuable life skills, including discovering when not being self destructive I could be creative and productive.Through studying artists of past and present, my interests began to lean towards realism, to include Nature, Southwestern, Portraits and concept artwork. It also created a progressive shift in my behavior.Œæ It has helped me become more patient, focused and social-able. "
819," Last Christmas I was given a set of sharpies as a gift. I began drawing basic images as an outline and then filling them with my doodles. This has always been a form of relaxation for me. In school, I always had the fun notes with doodles in the margins, and I had the full set of gel pens that I kept tucked away and never shared. Come to think of it, I still do that. I really only share my markers with my six-year-old daughter who also shares my passion.ŒæI have started an Etsy store and attended a few craft shows with my matted art. This has given me enough success to continue my hobby, but I really want to share my art on a larger scale. I color with my daughter often, but nothing has ever been ""cool"" enough for me to be proud of and actually keep.I want to share some of my images with others, and hopefully they will be ""cool"" enough to tear out and frame. Coloring is such a wonderful, relaxing pastime. I hope that adults and children alike will fall in love with this coloring book and enjoying filling in the pages together.I am so excited for this venture, and I have began the process of getting a proof created through our local printing press. I hope that this wonderful site will get me started, and I can, in the process, share my art with you!

820," Hello! My name is Patricia, and I'm an illustrator and a graphic designer from Barcelona, Spain. I've been traveling around the world for the last two years. In every place I go I illustrate and document everything that's around me.ŒæAt one point I realized I was creating an artistic bucket list, where everything that was drawn meant that it was done. If you don't know what's a bucket list is a list of all the experiences you want to have or goals you want to achieve before you die.I thought ""this could be a great project, an art collection of all the experiences I want to do in my travels for the next few months""That's howŒæ""The Bucket List Art project"" began. An art collection of all the experiences I would like to have before I die.But of course I couldn't do this all by myself. I needed help. I talked to my husband, Christopher, because he has worked several times with online networks, website development and that was an important part of the project.ŒæThat's how we createdŒæPatricia Otero studio, a studio where art, creativity and travel unites. We both needed more help soŒæI decided to talk with my sister, Anabel, because she is an excellent photographer and videographer and we really need that for a project of this size.ŒæTogether, as a team, we could do this. I made a list of all the things we all wanted to do in our travels and I chose 100 travel experiences I wanted to paint with my own style. Experiences such as:There is many experiences in the bucket list, but after a few months, I will have done and drawn 100 of them, and I will be able to have a big art collection of travel experiences.ŒæThese are not only artistic pieces but my memories and I want to unite them all in an online store. A store where every time someones buys a print of my illustrated bucket list they are buying a memory from a place or an experience, so they can make that memory totally their own.This prints are giclee  art prints, that means they are high quality printed in a watercolour paper of 300g. You could not tell the difference between an original and the print.ŒæShipping is included in the price!The diagram below represents where all the funds will be allocated to. Part of the funds are dedicated to our next trip, basically to my material along the 8 months and the remaining funds will be directed to printing, packaging, and taxes.ŒæŒæ*Examples of my artAfter the Kickstarter campaign finishes, in June, Patricia Otero studio will start traveling. The destination it's not clear yet, because we don't know if the project is going to succeed. But our options are starting with Canada or SouthAmerica. From June until January we will travel, document, and I will be drawing as we go in our adventures. Some artistic pieces of the bucket list will be drawn as we make them happen, others will be drawn because we want them to happen.ŒæI will be posting all the updates on the website www.patriciaoterostudio.comŒæand on instagramŒæhttps://instagram.com/patricia.otero/Œæ.

822," We need art in our homes: live, contemporary art. Art inspires our creativity and soothes us with beauty, stimulating our minds and raising our thoughts. We humans have been surrounding ourselves with contemporary art since we decorated our cave dwellings, recording, teaching, and fulfilling our natural love for ornamentation. What will contemporary art do for you?The ProblemContemporary art is almost always unaffordable. Many galleries take as much as 50%-70% commission on a piece of art. Artists need to create. They can't afford the time or the cash outlay to babysit a storefront. Crafters are turning to eCommerce site such as Etsy to sell their wares. A few fine art sites sell very high end, established painters' or sculptors' work. But they work on the same punishing cost margins as the brick and mortar galleries they represent. It's no wonder most of us don't own original art.Let's Solve This!I want to make art affordable.  I make art for gamers, sci-fi and fantasy fans, tattoo aficionados, niche genre fans of all stripes. Are you a Brown Coat? A 501st storm trooper? A Hoovian? Trekkie? My art will fill your soul!Art drips off my walls, both my own and from other artists. This year I will be taking months to make art for people without charging gallery prices. From $1 drawings to custom wall sized canvases, I will create art for you. Whether you are just discovering art beyond the old masters and kitsch of modern overproduction or you've have found a true fondness for a less than blank wall, I'll create art that will improve the places where you live, work and play.Below I have posted some of the art I've completed in the last month. As this Kickstarter continues, I will post an image of every piece that gets sent out to you, my contributors. Special Requests Custom orders may take longer to deliver. Please let me know the details of your request. I I will do my best to accommodate you and give you a clear expectation of your delivery date."
823," Initially Ping Pongäó»s diary started just with a simple thought. What if a dog could suddenly be aware that some people actually eat dogs? How he would react right after that? This is when Ping Pong came into the spotlight, a stray dog living in Beijing who one day found out that some people in China actually eat dogs.From that moment his life turned completely upside down and Ping Pong started to react weird for 72 consecutive days. Sometimes, Ping Pongäó»s behavior is silly or crazy but sometimes he shows sings of high intellect and great compassion.The story starts with a terrible news but it ends in a positive way: Ping Pong is adopted by some animal rightäó»s foundation in Berlin and the torture days are finally over. Luckily, not all human beings are evil.Why Ping Pong? Well, if it's not that obvious, Ping Pong is exactly like a table tennis ball: relatively small, white and constantly agitated.At this stage Ping Pongäó»s diary was intended to be more like a personal project but then it turned out that this diary could indeed have a purpose.Ping Pong decided to publish his story and share his chaotic experience. In this way he can raise some awareness about the dog meat consumption. He was recently adopted but he will never ever forget his dramatic period in Beijing. Being very loyal, like any other dog, Ping Pong wants to achieve more than just publishing his diary.Œæ Many of his fellow friends are still living in agony so, if the diary gets funded, his desire is to also help and save other dogs from being slaughtered. Ping Pong needs 150.000 swedish kronas for this project, which is approximately 18.000$, 16.000ä‰å or 12.000Œ£.The ultimate goal for Ping Pong is to get in touch with several dogäó»s rights foundations and give something in return, to close the circle. Well, the diary will be printed on A5 format (14.8cm x 21cm), soft cover most likely and it will include the entire 72 days of Ping Pong's chaotic experience, on 72 pages. Like in the examples below, everything will be printed on yellow, black and white.Ping Pong's rewards are straight forward and very personal. You can receive the Ping Pongäó»s diary in a digital or print version. When things get a little personal, you can receive the printed version of the diary carefully signed by Ping Pong. You can also officially become Ping Pongäó»s friend by having your name mentioned in the diaryäó»s friends list. If you want to be one of Ping Pongäó»s best friend...well, then you will also receive a personal handwritten letter from Ping Pong. When Ping Pong wants to communicate something he just barks. He doesn't really understand why humans have such a sophisticated and useless communication system: Facebook, Twitter, Skype...and oh God, how many more.Sometimes he's a bit capricious but still very friendly. You can get in touch with Ping Pong on Facebook, Gmail and rarely on Twitter, as he doesn't have the necessary skills to catch a bird.Facebookstraydogstory@gmail.com@ThisPingPong"

I've been drawing since I was young, but never took art classes in school, choosing instead to do stupid maths.I taught myself how to draw by drawing videogame fanart.

I will also be able to take classes to explore new techniques and media. Drawing for you will also expand my skill set, and my portfolio.I will also create an online gallery for you to watch my progress as I learn.Thank you for taking the time to check out this project.

827," *Awaiting badly made video, will arrive in 48 hours!*Our project is called The Fabulous Females of Video Games and here's everything you need to know about it!ŒæŒæOur aim to create a full-colour illustrated book that celebrate the achievements, attitudes and pure badass-ness of our top 20 female video games characters from both mainstream and indie titles that we all know and love!It will include double-page spreads dedicated to each character, with a full colour image on one page and a fact file dedicated to them on the other. The book will be perfect bound and will have a durable softcover (If we reach our stretch goals, it goes hardcover!).ŒæBUT WHY?! Why are we doing this? It's a pretty simply answer; As an average, there are far less female characters in video games that have strong personalities or deep back-stories and motives when compared with the amount of male characters. However, a large portion of video game players happen to be female! This project is not aimed to create anger or to denounce one gender from another, it is simply to celebrate the characters we DO have in the gaming world who are female, and as a result we hope it simply continues discussions and talks within the community and industry to continue creating female characters that all players can relate to.ŒæŒæIt's important to note that we will be re-drawing every character, these illustrations are simply to show our work! These will not be in the final cut!REWARDS!! We love community, and if you decide to support our Kickstarter then we will reward you for joining our community!

828," Was Jesus a Raging Douchebag?We all know that Jesus freaking loves everybody and is awesome!But others have been misinformed or hurt.This is a graphic novel that fights against the constant hatred that churches (religious hypocrites) & street preachers pour out on the public. in a satirical way this book explains why we should ignore religious jerks and appreciate Jesus for what he has done. It's written in a way that will grab the attention of skeptics and draw them into amazing art and hilarious content.ŒæIt explains who Jesus really is, how he feels about religious jerks, how to deal with them the way Jesus did, and why there have been so many people in history who followed his example.Jesus People are those of us who love Jesus, love others, and live rather than beligerantly scream at others.None is shamed, threatened, humiliated, or guilted into God's love.ŒæIt's his kindness that leads us to repentance.The book finishes by explaining what salvation is in a non threatening way that makes sense and helps the person know how to connect next.Religious tracks are a outdated thing of the past, let's change the world together.This book will change the way ministry is done and all the proceeds will go into printing and distribution. Mostly printing.Printing is expensive and can vary depending on paper, ink, binding, and so much more. I want to make this the best it can be and lay the foundation for more in the future."

830," I started drawing unusual and abstract images during my fragile college years, and began exploring modes of alternative consciousness using plant medicines. As a result, my art rapidly evolved into a psychedelic smorgsabord of intricate, undulating, swirling images that are inspired and influenced by plant medicines, mushroom dimensions, spirits, underworld iconography, shamanism, magic, ancient ancestors, cosmic beings, tarot, ascension, DNA and genetics, evo and involution, and more.This colouring book is a variety package of my favorite pieces of artwork, reprinted for your colouring pleasure. These images will encourage different perspectives of consciousness and tease your brain for hours on end. Each book is the accumulation of over 100+ plus hours of drawing and is a labor of love.ŒæI am self-publishing using local printers with paper I have purchased myself. Each book costs roughly $5.00 to print and ship; your generous funds are used to offset printing costs and support higher-quality printings in the future.ŒæThank you!

Even before I knew what the pictures meant, or how to do a reading for that matter, the images always fascinated me.They are a timeless collection of the human experience covering everything from love, life, death, spirituality, etc.. I now have many decks, ranging from anime pin up girls to Egyptian Book of the Dead symbols. As amusing and diverse as these iterations are, they can be very hard to use in a reading. Some are far too artistic to be practical. My goal in drawing 'The Mutation Tarot' was to keep it practical. In that respect, most of the images are steeped in the Rider-Waite tradition. I wanted to see if I could capture the same human aspects depicted in the cards by using non-human subject matter, in this case, mutated creatures from my dreams.""Mario Rosa, creator of The Mutation TarotThe Mutation Tarot deck is the result of a year and a half long project, by illustrator Mario Rosa, to re-imagine the spirit, symbols, and imagery of the Tarot cards without using human beings.

833," There is beauty in the unexpected and sometimes trauma can be a great motivator. I recently and suddenly lost someone I profoundly loved and the loss made me realize that life is short but it is also deeply beautiful. Although art has always been my passion, I did not ""own"" it. Instead I hid it away, afraid to be criticized or seen as ""unworthy"". But, as my Love would remind me, you must take risks, be vulnerable and step out into that leap of faith. And so, I offer my art to the world in a bold color. The SilverThorn Story coloring book is what kept me focused, sane and creative when I wanted to fold and give up. Creating something colorful and unexpected let my mind go to the places in dreams where beauty still thrives. Painting mandalas has long been used as an effective meditation technique and these drawings can be used in the same way. Let your mind wander and wonder where The SilverThorn Story will lead. Follow the breadcrumb trail and explore your own hidden depths of creativity and beauty. Many of my drawings are based on the idea of iconic goddesses. Many of them have one eye hidden as a symbol that we never really see the full picture and we all have a hidden inner self. The SilverThorn Story coloring book is filled with 22 original drawings, each with a unique, poetic name to stimulate your imagination. Use whatever means you like to bring the drawings to life with beautiful, magical color - paint, marker, pen, colored pencils....even finger paints if you want to let your fearless inner child-self shine.

841," When I was asked to produce this year's Atlanta Veg Fest poster design I immediately became obsessed with the idea of producing a vintage style Art Nouveau piece that I could offer as a high quality print. To me, this meant a large scale, full color, limited print complete with Gold Leafing. Unfortunately, in today's market of print-on-demand sites, the idea of a high quality print has been lost to the concept of low cost, fast turnaround printing usually produced on a large laser printer. In this world of laser printing it is impossible to produce a true ""Gold Leafing"" effect consisting of actual gold ink (that beautiful effect of the gold changing as the viewer interacts with the piece is completely lost). It is my intension with this Kickstarter to produce a true high quality 5 color 18"" x 24"" print that will include this ""Gold Leafing"" effect. I feel this is the best way to reproduce the original illustration giving you something that you will truly be happy with!To me the real attraction for this Kickstarter is the final printed poster. Therefore, rather than loading up this campaign with numerous rewards (which to me just get confusing after the first 10 or so) I have decided to limit the rewards to just a few key levels. All shipping and handling is included within the price - SOŒæFREE SHIPPING...YEAH!!"

I currently just enrolled in barber school, and the only way I'll really be making any money this long year is by doing tattoos. School is going to consume the majority of my week, seeing as I'll be going fulltime, and I'll be at the shop any hours I'm not in class. So you're investing in me, which I need these supplies and a machine to make money. I have a daughter, named Eisley on the way, and I don't want my girlfriend to worry about all financial responsibility, and she needs the help from me. If anyone is curious of why I set. My pledge at 2k, that's because art supplies alone are very pricey, and tattoo machines and supplies for that are very expensive as well. If you have any questions, please feel free to  ask.

845," For four months I have been working on a illustration of New York and it is finally done. My goal was to capture the essence of New York in a fun abstract illustration.

846," Good evening, are you sitting comfortably?ŒæThe basic premise behind these prints is that they are runts, outcast and forgotten about I've never seemed to get them to print. Some I underrated and so ignored. Others I doubted whether I'd got it 100% how I'd like and so squirrelled them away. Abused, forgotten, mistaken, betrayed and mistimed all these prints have gotten to the cusp of production and then fallen short. And so now sometimes years after they're production I've decided to force the issue and give these miscreants a chance at life, a crap series of Frankenstein's monsters if you will. Each print has a little story which I'll include under each image below. Enjoy this police lineup and see it as it can only be... A mess.Is over 5 years old and was one of my first endeavours into street art and screen printing. It just seemed at the time that revolutionary Yorkshire gardener Alan Titchmarsh just wasn't that 'street', plus lacking confidence it could stand up against other graffiti artists in the lost file it went. The veg patch edition below is a variant I made especially for kickstarter. The only thing red Alan Titchmarsh would support is his tomatoes come springtime. Everything about this piece gives me the creeps which is weird as I produced it. The crosses on the eyes are some kind of malevolent taunt to the boatman on the river Styx. He's looking at you but he's not, the crosses obscure his eyes but you don't want to meet his stare. When I made this I think I thought that the implied reference to child abuse and the church were a bit too strong and I couldn't stomach it. In retrospect it's a burning effigy and one that can now haunt you. Don't like looking at it for too long though...Continuing on the murderous child theme are three different versions of the piece 'Baby KILLA'. The colours are of the infant palate named after things loving parents would be interested in 'mothercare' and 'custard'. This saw a lot of action on the streets as it was a paste up poster I personally used all over the place but was also a freebie I gave out to people. I genuinely can't remember making this piece, all I remember was that it would be too awkward to produce just a few so I'd have to make a few different versions to make it possible. Thereafter it stalled. Originally I wanted the blocks to read 'Killer' as if proper spelling matters to a 2 year old murderer. Instead I went for the Wu Tang version 'KILLA' thus the child goes from a deranged serial killer in the making to a 90s gang banging infant.For this Kickstarter venture I resurrected an old 'drips' style I used to use where I'd splurge paint on a wall then paste over it. You can the variant style screen print. The baked beans variant is just cause I really wanted a print with baked beans in it. Seemed appropriate. ŒæThe idea with the 'Ravans' came to me whilst watching Ravens raiding rubbish bins next to McDonalds. Beside the pillaging were a group of Womies (white homies devoid of the slightest trace of gangsta) wearing cheap knock off Ray bans. I couldn't see the difference between the two groups. If anything the ravens would have stolen the glasses off the faces of the wude boys (white rude boys; it works in patterns) and were thus more credible than Wanilla Ice and the boys (Vanilla Ice but white...wait...). I blasted out the design for these guys quickly but then lost faith in myself as the imagery started to look more and more like an actual Raybans advert. As I pondered and pondered about what to do, my mind quickly drifted off into thinking up cheap ridicules of the white middle class...ŒæOriginally I was going to stick this image over British 'give way' signs and a subversion of the road signs original meaning. Instead of give way to oncoming traffic, it was a distant plea and silent plea hidden in plain view as an ominous prediction of future doom.Not too bad an idea. Problem was I was too ambitious. I wanted this stuck up on a motorway give way sign pasted over it.  And I managed it. But within two hours it was taken down. I tried again. Again down within a few hours. I tried a few more times but lost interest. The spot was prize but if no one saw it was it worth it? Maybe I could put them up on less policed but thus less exposed give way signs? But how could I forsake the highly viewed motorway for boring suburbia? Nobody tootalling along at 30mph in a 20mph zone gives a monkeys about the crumbling of mankinds future, let alone looks at road signs. Overconfidence vs incredulity. Neither won. The piece never saw light again.  ŒæThis 8 bit skull design was my fourier into retro 80s style icons. I used to DJ and this skull head was part of my logo. I never made it as a DJ (or an artist) and so I forgot about it.Skullface was of course never made/born in the 80s and neither is the 90s variant. I wanted it to be as close to a shell suit as possible. ŒæNazis and North Korea. Easy pickings for totalitarian mockery. The nazi slag fest is done. They're such a simple target my refined tastes (ahem) wouldn't allow such an easy satire. So Kim Jong UN it is then. The problem is somewhere down the line I lost my way and ended up mixing Ziggy Stardust with the Korean fat boy. But that wasn't my original purpose, I can't mix something infinitely cool with the infinite stomach of communisms poster boy. But I did and so I lost confidence (again) with my own ideas. I think the finished piece is good but as I lost the sense of what I made Ziggy Jong UN for I never published it. So here it is for you. Kim Jong Un bathed in the eternal glory of the North Korean flag.The handfinished version I'm making for kickstarter is my attempt to get back to the fortress of juxtaposition. The gay pride flag painted over his face. Aren't I clever. R"

851," Hello!  This is a fundraiser for Matt and Lauren Sparks to reprint their promotional bookmarks, business cards, and get some logo stamps made (something weäó»ve been wanting to do for a year). Weäó»ve printed all these things out-of-pocket previously, but not all at the same time. When put together, the total cost is formidable to the paltry sum currently in our business savings account.This Kickstarter is partially a necessity and partially an experiment- weäó»re both considering using Kickstarter in the future to raise funds for printing our independent comics, and so thought weäó»d dive in with a smaller project first! Weäó»ll see what happens! :DRewardsBasically, we want to trade bookmarks and original art for printing costs! Or, just bookmarks! Whatever you like. :)  As you can see in the original art reward tiers at right, you can have either Matt or Lauren draw you an artist trading card or a 9x12äó piece of character art - both in color.  These two sizes of artwork have proven very popular at comic book conventions, so we hope you enjoy them too!  Reward fulfilment will be in July (for bookmarks) and August (for original art).  This delay is so we can concentrate fully on producing all requested artwork, after finishing our biggest convention of the year  (HeroesCon in Charlotte, NC).Below you can see examples of Matt and Laurenäó»s work - they obviously have very disparate styles, but it can usually be boiled down to äóìMatt draws the cool stuff, Lauren draws the cute stuff.äóExamples of work by Matt and Lauren SparksMatt Sparks illustrated the last two issues of Hardcase by Scott Bachmann for Scott Comics and is currently penciling issue #1 of the comic book Viride, written by himself and Brenna Mudge. He colors his traditional work primarily in marker, and enjoys drawing heroic characters like Spiderman and Batman.Lauren Sparks has most recently illustrated issue #2 of Open Tree, Linus and the Fluke of Love by Chris Charlton for Assailant Comics.  She also writes and draws the silly webcomic Cats Talking Words, and wrote and illustrated a short story to the Kickstarter-funded Transitions Anthology. She colors her traditional work primarily in watercolor and enjoys drawing humans, cats and Pokemon."
852," I plan to do a series of drawings based on the book: ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" I'm  re-imagining the imagery and the characters of the book. I'm using a live model to be my ""Alice"" and will be using African sculpture as a visual basis to re-design the various characters. My cat, Clifford will be the model for the Cheshire cat. I'm employing the drawing technique of cross-hatching that I've always loved since I learned it in Art school. It's a drawing technique which actually was popular in illustration during the time that Lewis Carroll wrote the books and was used by John Tenniel who was the original illustrator of the books in 1865.If my campaign is successful, I plan to publish an Art volume in book form of my illustrations  with a re-imagined, poetic interpretation of the part of Carroll's text that is illustrated by the drawings. The illustration will be on one page with the re-imagined/poetic text on the opposite page.The total project, which is to be an 8 1/2"" X 11"" Art volume, will be a collection of approximately 40-50 drawings of various sizes. I've already started and am currently working on the drawings and I've completed six drawings so far in the series, parts ofŒæ which are shown here in the video. I hope to complete the drawings in six to eight months given my current schedule. Subsequently the books will be designed and published within 2 months after that.The funds will pay for all supplies needed to complete the drawings, the publishing cost to print 250 books and all rewards promised."

860," The true nature of this business is to supply life inspired artwork on premium quality skateboard decks.After the goal of my funds are met, i will take instant action upon ordering my designed decks featuring some of my personal artwork along with future collaborations with artists i meet along the way.The next step, after ALL of my backers receive their copy of any choice board, i will then launch an online store with a fully satisfactory shopping model for easy purchase. Followed by non-stop promotion on all social media networks along with personal promotion. (videos, blogs,newsletters, ect.)After a few months (roughly 6-8), i will then have a small skate crew together to help promote the brand as a whole to eventually take the show on the road.ŒæAll board purchases will be re-invested into other revenues such as stickers, trucks, wheels, apparel, and so on. There is no limitations when it comes to creating your own lane in the world of skateboarding and im speaking as a 28 year old who just started a year ago. Once my right foot touched that board i fell in love, and now my love for this newly discovered world (to me) has lifted my wings to this latent power that has finally awoken. I have a solid business plan to back all of my words."

Some of the things they spend hours and weeks sometimes working on are so stunning I find it hard to describe them in words.ŒæThe problem is most get out with absolutely nothing to start fresh with, which is why there is such a high rate of return. My goal is to reduce those numbers by allowing them a way to put away a little money to give them a better chance for success upon release. ŒæThey're not bad people, they just got lost along the way when they were young and paid for it for many years.ŒæI want to build and awesome website to showcase their designs and then deposit the money into accounts for them for use when they get out.

874," Hello Everyone,My name is T.J. and I am from the St. Louis Metro-Area. ŒæI have always had a deep passion for art.

876," An Elegy for Sivar will be the next campaign for the WCRPG system - and I'm hoping to fund an Origin Systems legend to do the artwork for it.The Wing Commander Role-Playing Game (also known as WCRPG for short) is a tabletop pencil-and-paper role-playing game system set in the Wing Commander universe. For those of you who are too young to remember or may have forgotten,ŒæWing Commander is an award-winning and ground-breaking series of space combat flight simulators, originally created by Chris Roberts and Origin Systems, Inc., and was one of the most popular video game series of the 1990s. Starting with the original game in 1990 and ending with Wing Commander: Secret Ops in 1998 (later followed in 2007 with Wing Commander: Arena), the series was known for a number of firsts in the video game industry, including some of the first examples of voice acting, one of the world's first full-fledged ""interactive movie"", one of the first games that could be played over a network, and one of the first ""episodic"" video games ever created.WCRPG's development began in earnest in 2011, with the Core Rules completed in 2013. The system was designedŒæto be as flexible as possible, so that players could be as detailed or as carefree as they chose to be. It also was designed as a compendium and primer to the series - players without any prior knowledge of the game universe could pick any era within the whole of the universe's continuity with which to play and have enough information available to them to be able to pick up on the general overarching story-line quickly. Information on how to build home-brew craft for use the engine was also included.ŒæThree adventure modules have been released for the system in addition to the Core Rules - Prelude to Goddard, Enyo and VespusŒæ- the last two of which were created as ""miniature campaigns"".For the duration of its history, WCRPG has been a completely non-profit project. The individual modules and Core Rules are completely free to download to the general public. In the past, hard-copies were also available, with costs there just covering the manufacturing.An Elegy for Sivar, also known as ""Elegy"" for short, is the latest WCRPG module currently under development. It is intended to be the WCRPG system's first full-fledged campaign setting, set in the year 2680 in a region of space known as Epsilon Sector. In addition to the campaign setting, a pre-published full-sized campaign will be included. The campaign tells the story of Krahtagh ""Bloodeye"" N'Ryllis, a Kilrathi pirate whose demise is chronicled in the documentation of Wing Commander: Prophecy. The main plot-line of the campaign will chronicle the activities of N'Ryllis's group, the Demon's Eye Pack, as they attempt to re-build Kilrathi society. The main campaign will has a total of 44 individual adventures planned, though it is structured such that only 16 of these missions comprise the main plot. The module will include enough additional data that player groups will be able to develop their own adventures within the setting. One final and unique feature of the guide will be a Kilrathi lexicon.That's a good question with a simple answer: the purpose of the Kickstarter project is not to fund the development of the campaign guide itself. Rather, the goal of the campaign is to fund the artwork that will appear in it. The artist I hope to hire to do the cover art for the project is none other than Denis Loubet.Denis Loubet is a renowned artist best known for his work on several pen & paper role-playing games and video games. His resume includes work with companies such as KingsIsle Entertainment, Hero Games and Steve Jackson Games, and his work has appeared in titles such as GURPSŒæand Ashen Empires.ŒæHe is also one of the co-founders of Iron Will Games and Pixelmine Games.ŒæHe was the first artist hired at Origin Systems, and was responsible for the design of many box cover paintings, manual illustrations, in-game art and animation, and cinematics for the company. This includes a good portion of the art for the company's two most successful series: Ultima and Wing Commander. His name appears at the top of the credits for Artwork inŒæWing Commander and his name is featured prominently in the Art credits forŒæWing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi.Recently, Denis has decided to move from working exclusively with companies to working directly for his fans. To that end, he's begun a Patreon project (at https://www.patreon.com/denisloubet) with a goal in part so that he can make his work for his Drawmycharacter site economically feasible. He visited the Wing Commander CIC forums (at http://wcnews.com/chatzone) in February to talk with some of the fans directly - a group that happened to include myself. He indicated that he would be interested in putting together a cover image for Elegy. And that's where all y'all come in:The initial goal of the project is $1,650 - that's $1,500 to pay Denis for his work on the cover, plus an extra 10% to cover all of Kickstarter's fees. At that level, Denis's work will appear on the front cover (and will no doubt be an awesome sight to behold...).The first stretch goal after that is $4,000. At that level of fundraising, the completed campaign will not only have Denis's work on the cover, but will also include portraits of the campaign's major characters in the guide's section on Characters. This would include portraits of Bloodeye, all of the main members of his Demon's Eye Pack, the campaign's major antagonists and a few more important characters. I would give priority to the members of the Demon's Eye Pack in the event that the project raises more than the minimum but less than the $4000 level.The second stretch goal is at $9,000. At that level, the guide will have a full array of art - including the cover and the characters, it will include a portrait in each of the campaign's planned 44 adventures.Should the project raise funding beyond that level, I would investigate the possibility of a vanity printing of hard-copies of the final Elegy guide.As mentioned, the WCRPG Project has always been a non-profit effort, whose finished products are available as free downloads. One unfortunate side effect of this is (in this case anyways) a relative lack of incentives I can give y'all to donate to the project. There are a few things I can offer y'all, however:For donations of $100 or more, I'll add a character to the campaign in your honor. If have any specific requests to go along with your character (like how they look, what their job is, etc.), by all means let me know. You'd have your choice of species and affiliation for that character - be they a Confederate Pilot, a Border Worlds mercenary, a Firekkan Merchantman, a Kilrathi politician...you name it, it's yours.Those giving at least $25 to the project will get their names added to the game's credits, as my way of saying ""Thanks for helping this guide be as awesome as I can imagine it being.""ŒæAny donation is greatly appreciated; those who can contribute less than $25 will still be mentioned in the credits, though as a ""generous contributor"" rather than by name."

879," I have been brainstorming this Idea after I was divorced. I did not want to be separated from my beautiful daughter. The separation left a huge whole in my heart and, I would imagine it was the same feeling for my daughter. I wanted to let her know that she was not alone in her loneliness, So I thought I could bridge that gap of separation. I believe this will be a great way to show other children separated from their fathers or mothers that the love is still there. I have made painting my passion and the pursuit of children's books; My mother says everything happens for a reason and I am inclined to believe her. I am excited for a chane to to shine in children's hearts with vi vivid and healing illustrations that can strengthen relationships. I am beyond honored if your reading this and ask you to say a prayer or meditate towards my dream. My heartfelt hope is that this book will touch the life of children's and parents around this world.Sincerely Jon J. lambertBlessings!!!!"

881," ŒæA Little About The Creator:Hi, my name is Al aka ""Al Viino"" (Yes... That's two I's...lol). I am an artist, illustrator, painter and the creator of Leo Finito & The Concrete Safari.ŒæI created Leo Finito & The Concrete Safari to be unlike any of the many other iconic ""cute and adorable"" characters that seem to be the standard, which most people have grown to love, and to aim to entertain adult audiences.When I created these characters I immediately began to share them in my posts online via social media by photobombing friends, celebrities, movies, you name it. After such a short amount of time sharing my posts, I have been able to create a new channel of getting a good amount of traffic, awesome followers and Œæsupporters.Now I am reaching out to the Kickstarter community to share my goal of taking Leo Finito & The Concrete Safari further.About Leo Finito & The Concrete Safari:Leo Finito is the main character out of his obnoxious small crew of stuffed friends from the ""Concrete Safari"". Each character represents a different set of subliminal emotional barriers that people may find themselves facing throughout life and love.Leo Finito is a stuffed lion with loose stitching and stuffing protruding through his appendages, which signifies that he patched himself up from all the painful experiences he has faced throughout life and love. Due to his past experiences and relationships, Leo Finito has no filter andŒæ carries a nonchalant, obnoxious, care-free, and over-flirtatious demeanor. ŒæLeo Finito & The Concrete Safari was created as a way to creatively express the feelings and emotions that can or might have been taken granted within past or current relationships by adding a sense of what I call ""innocent reckless humor"". Each character has their own story that I'm confident many others may be able to relate to.About This Project:Iäó»ve been a fan of Kickstarter for quite some time, and after seeing success after success from other awesome projects, I decided to give it a shot.ŒæI have taken each of the nine characters from pencil and paper sketches to completely digitizing each one by myself, and now I would like to be able to take Leo Finito & The Concrete Safari and create a new line of awesome collectible products, and merchandise. By reaching this funding goal, I will be given the opportunity to create prints, stickers, greeting cards and posters. If this project can exceed beyond this campaign with your help, then that would grant the ability to finally produce actual plush and vinyl toys of each character!Follow Leo Finito X The Concrete Safari:"

884," The plan is to offer my co-working space as a studio and place of work for selected individuals from Indonesia and around the globe creating a hub of artists.

We will also use these funds for company registration.$5000-$10,000 will be spent developing website and formalise gallery with in Salty Volt.$10,000-$15,000 will be spent on acquiring a location specific for creative studio space. A separate location to Salty Volt where artists can paint, draw and create. A wet space/ creative space/ community studio.We would like to create a mecca of artists that can live and work in paradise, developing their projects while feeding other like minded talents in a range of creative fields while assisting and giving exposure to Indonesian artists.A Western meets Asian art explosion developed from the new, trending capital for hipster /creatives with a surf/ travel fusion. ŒæArt being created alongside the entrepreneur community that visits our island home! Watch artists transform their projects into life, while working from the idyllic surrounds of the perfect office-ŒæSalty Volt.ŒæThe creative juice is flowing like a volcano here already but no one has brought everyone together in unity under one roof andŒæharnessedŒæits potential. It would be the most exciting project Bali has seen in a long time and would send ripples through the arts community, finally cementing Indonesia as a world leader in the arts fields.In short, the concept is to create a data base of leading artists within Indonesia, then scout for Western talents that would consider travelling to Bali to share their knowledge and experience. We would arrange workshops and talks and open the space for events. It would be open to the public and all works developed would be showcased in the space.We will then offer representation by the way of an agency and source work globally using our already established network so the artists can develop their careers and spread their wings, hopefully giving them huge exposure."

894," 	Hello to everyone that takes the time to read this. I formerly attended two years of college, one year at an art college, but due to funding issues I could not continue my education as I would have liked. I am currently an independently contracted illustrator and use traditional media but I am lacking the clientele to make a living at it. My art is one of the few things I have ever been passionate about in my life and I hope to make a career out of it. 	What I am starting this campaign to do is to help me follow my dream by helping fund starting an online shop to sell my art. I am creating a shop on ETSY to help me hopefully get my work out into the world and get people to see it. I have designed several small cards that I intend to get prints made and sell as greeting cards, birthday cards, or postcards along with my other work.	This is something I have wanted for years and never possible. What the donations I receive from this campaign is going towards is funding having the prints professionally done. I have found a professional print shop in my city that works with local artist to make high quality prints of there work. 	In order to Pay for the set of prints and supplies to get started I am hoping to raise around $600. Along with the prints the money will be used to pay the fee to have the cards up online to sell them. I donäó»t have much to offer in the way of perks, the set of cards in my pitch image are actually mini cards and not the ones I am intending to get prints made of, anyone that donates will get a hand drawn mini card similar to those shown. Even if I cant reach my goal any funds I do receive will go towards getting whatever prints I can. 	I understand I am relying on the generosity of others to achieve my goal and I donäó»t expect to get rich off of this and understand there is a risk to starting my own shop, it will take time and effort that I intend to put forth to succeed. Over the years I have taken on custom commissions work and done illustrations for people but with help I can expand and get my work out into the world. 	While it will take time for my work to be seen and/or sold I am determined to see it through and help it grow. Because my shop is online I will be using social media to help spread the word about my shop and the work I am doing. 	Even if you cant help I thank you for taking the time to read this and ask that you share this with others and help me to get the word out and bring attention to what I am trying to do, it all helps me. So please help me get the word out and bring attention to my shop. 	So once more, Thank you for anything you can do. "
895," RPG games are my girlfriend's favorite hobby. But I know nothing about it. I'm not a nerd or into geek things by any stretch, but I think it's a really fascinating hobby. D&D, WarHammer, Star Wars, World of Darkness (Geist).... these are the ones she tends to play. The project image is her current RPG character, a tiefling. She asked me to draw her and so I did a quick sketch.ŒæIt got me thinking that this could be a great way for me to learn more about her hobby, and to practice drawing again.ŒæI love to draw, it's the one thing that makes me forget to eat for a whole day while I'm doing it. There's a manga comic I've been working on for years and have a complete script for that I've dropped in the past year due to getting side tracked by life. Admittedly I need to get back into practice. Drawing is my real passion in life, the one thing I cant not do, and I really want to make it my career and focus in life. I'm hoping that this kickstarter will help me raise enough money to make my life stable and give me the practice I need to pursue my dream.So, back to my girlfriend. I want to get my life in order for her, as she's been with me through so much and has always been a source of hope in my life. A few years ago I left school, during another rough patch in my life, and Ive been left with the debt from my student loans. All the proceeds from this kickstarter will go towards paying that down, so that my credit will improve enough for me to get an apartment for my girlfriend instead of always renting rooms.

898," AbstractThe basic concept of this project is coating a car in white, matte wrap and use it as a canvas to create a modern mixture of art and design. By backing this project, you are helping me to reach my dream of owning a car that was entirely drawn over by myself and thus creating a piece of art.ŒæAbout MeMy name is Alen Peric and I am a 20 year old guy. I was born in Slovenia where I spent the majority of my childhood. Once I turned 13 I moved next door to Austria, where I attended an art and design school. I also did an exchange year in Vermont, USA where I took some art and photography classes. Last October I decided to pack my bags and move to Canada to live on my own. I have loved art since I was a kid and spent countless hours drawing pictures on paper. It has always been my dream to own a car that was entirely painted by myself and I am hopping that you will help me accomplish my dream.The ProjectI always loved the idea of individualism and since I think owning a car is a part of making a statement about yourself, I have always strived to find a way to show that trough art. What better way is there than taking an object and modifying it to suit your own traits and character?ŒæThat is why I have decided to start this project. I would like to take a car which I consider as an amazing feat of modern design and add my own touch to it. Due to lack of personal funds I would like to turn towards Kickstarter and the amazing people out there to help me fund my project and help me achieve my dreams.Basically the more money we can raise, the better car I can afford to cover in art. For the project I will use sharpies. Most of drawings will be sketched first but I will add some spontaneous art to fill the blank spots. The goal is to cover at least 85% of the car in drawings. I am planning on making several bigger drawings (20x20inch) and several smaller drawings(<15x15inch). I am planning on spending around 60-90 hours on drawing. Furthermore there will be a central topic of the artwork that will get voted on by the community group on Facebook.ŒæOnce done I will make a photoshoot of the car and every backer will receive an email with a couple shots that will make for a nice wallpaper. Furthermore every backer will receive a personalized thank you note from me. If we can reach 10,000$ I will also record a small documentary and upload it on youtube on the making of the art and also every backer will be mentioned in the credits.TimetableCarsDue to the price fluctuation I cannot post exact years of the cars that I would like to purchased but most of these would be purchased used as I am trying to keep the cost of the project down while upgrading the vehicle.CostThe cost will be spread as following:A minimum of 400$ will be spent on a camera that will be used to document the project, about 100-150$ will be spent on Sharpie pens while the rest of the money will go towards the car and the vinyl wrap.ŒæFinal WordsI just wanted to take another few lines to tell you how excited I am about this project and how grateful I am to anyone who decides to support me in pursuing my dream. I have wanted to do a project like this for as long as I can remember as art has been a very big part of my life. Thank you for your consideration and I am really looking forward Œæ to sharing my art with the world."

902," Shaun RemeleI have grown to recognize and appreciate the commercial application of art in today's society. For that reason, I became attracted to the field of Graphic Design. Previously, art for art's sake always seemed to be a waste of time to me. Then, I realized: art for art's sake is where the challenge is - and that is where I want to be.ŒæWhile there is a lot of value in my education as a graphic designer, I have begun to venture further with my artistic education. Now, I am closer than ever to achieving a long-time dream of mine: working in the field of Animation Media. And that vision grows clearer everyday.Some of the vision has yet to be realized; there are many things that just can't be learned in a classroom. And that, my dear Kickstarterites (proper noun, fictitious: one who is of Kickstarter),Œæis where you come in.ŒæExperience is hard to come by for a newcomer like myself. Even though I have experience illustrating as a hobby, my graphic design experience does not translate fluently into a more focused, fine-art industry. Animation and Illustration is a whole different beast with its own artistic challenges. And in that regard, I don't carry a reputation as an illustrator or have work experience in media animation. So what is one to do as a student fighting to get to the top of the creative food-chain?The answer is simple: share work, gain exposure, and create a relationships with you: the avid backer.ŒæMy objective can be split into three parts. Primarily, it is my aim to gain measurable experience. Secondly, I seek to achieve a large volume of work to challenge my skills and push me beyond my creative limits. Finally, I seek to achieve a few extra bucks in the proccess as a means to help ease the cost of my continuing education.ŒæPath to success has ever been carved without some hard work; and that is exactly what I am seeking here on Kickstarter. Without the hard work, my successful animated future is nothing more than pipe-dream.Well, besides my affection - which, if you've read this far you've already long-past earned - you can get one of a the many awesome rewards. To stay true to my campaign objective, I have made it a point to obtain as much experience as possible. To do that, I have plenty of rewards that will be completely unique in which that no two people will receive the same end-product.And no, that does NOT mean that the same illustration will be reproduced by hand to seem unique. My aim is to achieve a large volume of work to expand my creative insight. Every. Single. Illustration. Is. Unique.While you may not know what kind of illustration you earned until you receive it, every Illustration is guaranteed to be one-of-a-kind. My aim is to explore numerous medias and work in different styles. This, for me, is an opportunity to grow. For you, it is an opportunity to get a really awesome, unique piece of art.You can check out the reward tiers to the right to explore your options for media sizing, shipping, and quantity. Everything offered is layed out there. Questions about any of the rewards (or anything at all) are welcomed in the FAQs.While I really hope you'll make the decision to support my campaign, I hope that you'll pass it along in the instance that you've chosen to take a pass this time 'round.ŒæAny individual that is interested in supporting a growing artist like myself will be welcomed with open arms!With the community of interested backers, whether it beŒæsupporting artists or a collection of the average Joes, I am confident I can produce the results that I need to compete in the fine-art's game. By allowing me the opportunity to expand upon my current skills as an illustrator, this campaign - with the help of it's backers - will thrust me forward in my journey in having my animated future realized.ŒæThank you so much for your time and support."

I would like to inspire people who believe that there is no true success in art. They should have a space where they can learn that if there is a will there is a way. I have taken many art classes and know quite a few artists who would love to participate and contribute to the fruition of such a space. This small art venue is only the beginning of a vision. This studio will eventually be pioneered into not only a place to display art work but also to create it. A work studio would be started next where people can get work done in a comfortable environment, either bringing their own supplies or purchasing supplies bought in bulk by myself and discounted to remain affordable.

912," How well do you know Columbus, Ohio? Sure, the winters may be as long and as gray as a wizard's beard,but the beauty and magic of this realm are only as far away as your imagination. Tom and I believe that fantasy and enchantment are all in the way you look at things.So two years ago we put together A Map of Silidor Valley, otherwise known as Silicon Valley or the San Francisco Bay Area, showing the hidden nature of the urbanrealm we live in. One of our fabulous backers and a native son of Columbus, commissioned me to do a map of his home town in the same fantasy style. Our backer is enjoying the original, so now weäó»d like your help getting this map printed and out to the masses. Our Columbourne map will be printed in four colors on high quality vellum paper. The matte finish gives it that old world feel. The 24-by-18 inch size fits in standard frames. Get it through Kickstarter and it will be hand signed by, well, me. We plan on retailing the map for $29.00, so by going through Kickstarter you'll also get a great deal.We've set up a website where we're currently selling our Silicon Valley map and plan to sell this map(and hopefully many others) after the Kickstarter project ends. We have the domain, www.urbanrealms.com andweäó»re not only selling or previous maps, but also a variety of D&D items that I designed. Check it out!Starting with the Bay Area was a no-brainer since we live there. But I'm a Midwestern gal, born in Wisconsin, so it was a pleasure learning about Columbus. From the Horseshoe at Ohio State, to the brewery area, to Big Walnut Creek, Columbus is full of variety and charm. And I now even know what a buckeye looks like! (How could you draw a map of Columbus without buckeyes?)Œæ I'd like to bring Columbourne to you in delicious four color mythicness. We're asking you to help us spread the magic of the äóìrealäó world. We are currently deciding between two different printers for the printing end of the project. Both are reputable businesses with long and successful track records. Our first proofs looks great. Just a few more tweaks and the artwork will be ready togo! All we need is a little financial backing. You can help us make it happen!Together we can bring a little bit of the other world to ours.BookmarksThe bookmarks are hand-antiqued (by me) in a process called tea dying. (As is the background for the original map.) That makes each a one-of-a-kind work of art. After printing and tea dying the bookmarks are laminated and decorated with a ribbon. You'll receive a set of four different bookmarks.T-shirtsWe know you love your city, so why not wear it on your chest? For the T-shirts we enlarged the downtown/ Ohio State area.The shirts are printed by Cafepress. They are available in either black or brown and in sizes from small to 3XL tall.JournalsOur journals also sport a close-up of the downtown/Ohio State area.

915," IntroHello Kickstarters! ŒæMy name is Rebecca, and I am launching this project to gather support and keep my work absolutely, 100% free. ŒæI make character coloring pages and try to focus on themes that are hard to find. ŒæParents can download and print the images and use for rainy days, travel activities, birthday parties, or whatever other uses they can think of. ŒæYou can view my current work here:becscoloringpages.blogspot.comPages on PinterestHistoryI first started making these pages for my own kids. ŒæThey would inevitably become obsessed with different characters and themes (I'm sure every parent can relate!), so I would continue making new illustrations that we could print and/or color in digitally on the iPad.In 2012, I began uploading my creations on Blogger and making them freely available to the public. ŒæI also created a board on Pinterest to share my work. ŒæSince then, the blog has reached over 200,000 viewers worldwide, and the Pinterest board is also taking off with over 80 followers and 500+ cumulative re-pins.The ProblemI create coloring pages just as a hobby, but creating them and maintaining them takes time and resources. ŒæAfter seeing how many people have enjoyed my work, I would like to be able to expand my collection.I typically create the drawings in one of two ways: digitizing hand-drawn sketches and original line drawings on an iPad. ŒæThese methods have worked in the past but can be difficult to work with and sometimes create low-quality images.Fund UsagesI am turning to Kickstarter to help earn funds to put towards a drawing tablet, creating new drawings, and updating the website. ŒæAll funds raised for this project will go 100% to supporting these three endeavors.RewardsIn return for financial support, I am happy to offer custom drawings to my backers. ŒæIn addition, I welcome feedback and suggestions from anyone backing the project."
916, Hey art loversŒæFancy a portrait of yourself or a loved one? Or how about a family picture?maybe even a pretty flower to hang on your wall? My ideas are endless and I need you guys to help me make this happen! Help me share my art with the world!!Check my video and picture updates or simply go to my website to check out some of my work
917," The World Wide Wave.Years ago as a child, I had the idea that it would be a funand interesting calling to spend my life travelling the globe with thechallenge of shaking hands with every person alive on the planet. The purpose?It was to be my symbolic bid to promote world peace and friendship from allreaches and corners of earth. Of course, this is not a realistic thing to do äóñit was a mere fantasy and a bizarre one at thatäó_just imagine, as soon as I hadleft one town or village, someone would be born, so Iäó»d have to return to shakethe new born babyäó»s little hand, and can you envisage managing a list of whoyouäó»d shaken and who you had yet to shake? It just wouldnäó»t be a sane challenge, and Iäó»d probablydevelop arthritis of the wrist after a few years from constant hand shaking. Isuppose heads of state and members of royal families get as close to fulfillingthis task as can be expected, and humble little me is not going to out-do themin this respect.However, good and crazy ideas refuse to go away, and Iäó»mstill trying to develop my global handshake. With your help, this is how we cando it:1. I begin in Margate, Kent, UK, where I presently live.2. As a cartoonist/illustrator, I will draw 24 randomcharacters that I meet, waving äóìhelloäó. The drawings will include landmarksthat show the town Iäó»m drawing from and a postcode (area code) where thecharacter was äóÖcapturedäó». I will attempt to shake their hand and get a name ifthey will allow me to do so.3. You might like to buy a reward, which will be a signedand original colour illustration, at Œ£25.00 per illustration of one of theserandom characters. Itäó»s a bit like having a pen friendäó_an image of someonecaptured from the other side of the world äóñ someone youäó»ll probably never meetwhoäó»s waving greetings and good tidings to you.4. There will be smaller rewards of limited editionpostcards, 6 characters per pack at Œ£5.00 per pack.5. The funds that I raise from this project will go towardsgetting my campervan back on the road, and then I can continue the project bytravelling further afield and drawing more people from different backgroundsand cultures. The project will snowball and the number of drawings willincrease over time.6. The project will be self-funding, and The World Wide Wavewill travel from Albania to Mexico to Zambia.7. I will keep the copyright, and you will have a one offoriginal piece of art, which will increase in value as the project develops andgains international recognition. 8. Eventually, the collection of character drawings will bemade into a book. But that bit comes later.Please check out my website to see my characters style ofdrawing. https://www.clarepattinsonillustration.comI will create a Facebook page called The World Wide Wave where you can follow the progressof the travels and characters.

919," The 48 original constellations were described by Ptolemy in the Almagest, and they were based on Greek myths and legends. Œæ80 more constellations were added over the years, mostly by 17th-Century European astronomers and cartographers, based on travels to the southern hemisphere. ŒæHeroes and monsters were relevant to the ancients, but why couldn't we give the night sky a facelift? ŒæWho says we're not due for Constellations 2.0? ŒæWhen you look up into the night sky, what do you see?My designs will be based upon Johann Bayer's 1603 prints of the constellations. ŒæI want to do modern images, but in that stylized, etching style. ŒæI would like the final images to be color images.Backers are encouraged to submit ideas to me through my Twitter account (@matsallehmanker) and be sure to include #skyupdate in your message.

920," After 25 years on this earth, I feel that I have finally found my calling ~ to be an artist.ŒæWhile I graduated with a degree in Economics, art truly is my passion. I discovered this just today (2/25/15) after drawing my own self-portrait (pictured in project description), and realizing that I really do have a knack for truly capturing the essence of individuals with just a pen in my hand and a piece of paper on my table.ŒæI will draw you, a friend, family member, your pet hamster- whatever you'd like me to sketch, for just $10 (plus shipping).ŒæDon't miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity.

921, Just want a opportunity to make great quality t shirt.
922," So the plan is pretty simple. You give me 3 bucks and I sent you a sticker of your choice. the stickers are high quality weathers resistant vinyl and kick ass.ŒæMy story goes like this: I graduated from college with nothing to show for it. Since I was the first person in any part of my family to do this my want to use my degree was seen as strange by my family. My mom has literally told me to work at McDonald's after I became a certified  teacher. Anyway a kid attacked me with an ice pick and that was the near end of me teaching. So I started a website and started making stuff hoping to promote myself as an artist, graphic designer and maybe to sell a little something to make some extra cash. So lets make some kick ass stickers for your car, laptops, or maybe to cover certain parts of the human anatomy in the chest area. I don't care what you use them for as long as you have fun.ŒæAnyway you buy a sticker and tell your friends and then I don't have to work at McDonald's. "
923," Hello. My name is Jessica Thomas. I'm the illustrator behind the project. I've been attending local conventions for years, and run my Etsy Shop in between. Stickers have always been loved by the fans of my artwork, and over the years I've improved upon the quality of them. I am currently hand-cutting all of my stickers, and while they still look nice, this project's goal is to further improve upon their quality. I want to upgrade my in-house equipment and buy a machine to cut the stickers for me. This will not only create smoother cut lines, but also increase the amount of stickers I can produce in a timely matter.Need to see more about me before you want to commit? You find me on these social sites:TumblrEtsyInstagramFacebookProject Goal: $500Equipment: $270Supplies Cost: $80Shipping fees: $100Kickstarter fees: $50Once the project is funded, the order for the equipment will be placed. It should arrive within 7 business days. All of the sticker files are ready to go, so it's simply a matter of set up once the equipment arrives. I'm allowing an additional 7 business days to get acquainted with the machine and have all the stickers cut out. All of the rewards (excluding commissions) will be sent out within the first month after the end of the project. Commissions can be expected within 2 - 3 months, depending on how many are pledged. The project timeline may change if certain stretch goals are met. I will keep the project updated as it progresses.5 new sticker designs will be created! All rewards from $10 and up will receive all 5 new stickers with their rewards.????? - Reaching the 1st stretch goal will unlock this one. - ?????????? - Reaching the 2nd stretch goal will unlock this one. - ?????"
924, I am going to search for the printing house to print my paintings with the short stories. I want my book to look outstanding and help to people realize that we are not the center of the world.
925," I'm in the Army. Everything so drab and blunt to an end and straight forward. I was raised a wild child and love creating new things. Poetry, short stories, drawings, doodles, collages. Just love making something new and sharing it. I would love to see if my version of expression in different ways is worth anything to anyone else. Hoping to make a difference or at least an impression in someones life. Its always been a goal to leave a footprint in someone elses path for them to remember someday. Life is about experiences and adventure. I would like to try and explore every path I believe in and see what all I am capable of making come true. Its always been a passion and I wonder now if I can make it a reality. By hopefully starting small on here to see what comes of anything and maybe some feedback will help me start a dream. Side dream anywho.Œæ "
926," I do notŒæhave aŒæ room in my Œæ house or a finished basement that I can store my craft projects.So becausee of that I have to deal Œæwith a number of distractions. This can hurt your professionalism and cause delay in progression of your work.I believeŒæit is crucial to draw a line between work time and personal time. If you are not careful, you will begin to mix work with your personal time and soon, you will be working all the time. Closing a door to the room where you spend a considerable amount of time working may help, butŒæwith no room designated for that it is not possible.That is why I need money to lease office/warehouse space."

929," I am creating custom T-shirts printed with Destiny fan-art created by me. I originally began drawing these pictures as a way to kind of ""get my feet wet"" so to speak after having not drawn anything in years, but having the desire to get back into it again. And since I had been playing (and loving) the video game Destiny, I decided to start by drawing creatures and characters from the game.I began posting those drawings on the Bungie.net message boards to gauge the reactions of other Destiny players. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with some forum users even requesting to purchase some of my work!After kicking ideas around a little, I decided to create this KickStarter page to see if anyone out there would be interested in these T-shirts featuring some of my Destiny drawings. I think they're pretty cool, and would look amazing on clothing, and I hope you do too!Oh, and anyone who donates between $30 and $49.99 to me will receive a high-quality art print of an image of their choosing! In addition, donate between $50 and $99.99 and receive one of these awesome T-shirts I'm working on, with a drawing or design of your choosing, in the color/style of your choice. And if you donate $100 or more, not only will I love you forever, but you'll receive both the T-shirt as well as the custom high-quality art print!! Thanks for stopping by!"
930," Receive, add, pass it on.So it's someone's birthday in the office and a card is going around for everyone to sign, a small comment of their own as their link to the birthday..person. They open it, and they see all varieties and personalities, they treasure it.Introduce a sketchbook, and amplify the scale...a lot.The aim here is to collect images, drawings,paintings,prints from all over the world, in one book then publish those results to show how we all connected.Receive: We will send you the pad / sketchbook / paper in an envelope / package suitable for you to re-use.Add: Draw, paint, print out a picture, a photograph, stamp the page - do whatever you want to add to the collage, the only rule is you can't go over someone else's image. Leave your name or nickname and rough location along side your creationPass it on: Get your friends to do it, get your family, heck, get your dog to walk through paint and stamp a foot print or four. Then send it back to us, address provided on request after successful funding.We want to get all sorts of creations from all sorts of people in all sorts of places. Each time the media is sent back to us, we will scan in the results as back ups then send it on to the next person. At the end, we will create a website, a gallery of the results, and publish a hardback book too.The funding limit is low for this project - why? We want to get as many people as we can, should more people want a book for example, that is not a problem, there is no limit to our rewards.Let's draw the globe, and see what the globe draws us.Any questions just give us a shout and we will get back to you before you even know it."
931," When you have passion for something, anything, the product of that energy will always come through. I have been capturing photos for over 25 years and each time the shutter releases, I am intrigued by the possible outcome. Life is an amazing canvas and I enjoy bringing the nuances of it through my imagery. Its this same focus that helped me developŒæwhat I call ""Photo Art"".ŒæMany times I would see a photo and envision what it would look like in a different format. Depth and layering, I felt, added another element to a picture. This was the foundation for many fun hours of creative designŒæ&ŒæI was able to bring the images to life in a wayŒæthat IŒæwas'ntŒæable toŒæoriginally.ŒæUltimately, a photo can stand on its own, its message unique and genuine already. My vision is to add an element beyond the reference point, outside the frame, and tell another story within the photo.ŒæCustomized PrintsIf you have a photo you would like me to work on, I would be happy to review the image and let you know if it is possible to create a rendering. Meaning, not all digital images are created equally, it most be large enough in size and resolution."
932," I have written the first book in a children's series, The Walk a Mile in My Shoes Club. ŒæI would like to update the illustrations in the first book and retain an illustrator for the rest of the series. ŒæI also would like to offer a hardback version of the books.The series is about bullies who learn what it's like to have to deal with the problems that their victims deal with every day. For example, the first book is called MIke and the Deaf Student. Mike, the bully, learns about what deaf people go through every day.I truly believe in the series and I know that it can teach children why bullying is wrong in a new and creative way. It's one thing to tell them it's wrong. It's another thing to show them why it's wrong."

ŒæPretty much anything that my brain could imagine would flow through the pencil onto any surface possible, from school desks to car windows!

ŒæI would love to draw the most hilarious random things and show them to my friends and that really felt good to make others smile through my work.Though recently I haven't doodled hardly at all. ŒæI decided that it would be a crime to give up such a childhood passion of mine. ŒæThen I had an idea, why not start doodling everyday and send them to people to brighten their day possibly!The money raised would help me pay for my college classes and more art!I look forward to doodling and improving my skills along with brightening random peoples day!"

But Ugly Animal Cardäó»s revolutionary messagesleeve givesŒæYOU the power toŒæmove people!Whenyou choose yourŒæfavorite animalŒæcard, UglyAnimal Cards provides clever, suitable and customizable message content for theoccasion or receiver AND youäó»re the hero. Simply select a message, write it inand give. TheŒæhandwrittenŒæmessage willsurprise the receiver with your witŒæandŒæcharm!YouTubebegan as a cat video hub, 216 MILLION have laughed at the sneezing babypanda...Creatures connect us!Animalsare part of our daily lives and experience the world with us - but offeraŒærefreshing perspective. They look different, livedifferent, think different, yet share so many of the emotions that we do... anddisplay them so genuinely. TheyŒælive in the moment.They are themselves. They donäó»t pretend to be someone or something other thanwhat they are. They do what they want and donäó»t hold themselves back. They are who we are when we aren'ttrying.Asfar as we, humans, think we have come from being äóìanimaläó äóñ its still there.Next time you sit a bus stop or stand in line, watch that rowdy group ofteenagers, or the mother with her children. Pay attention to their behavior,look past their talk and their attempts at social niceties... watch theirgestures and general expressions. See what they try to hide and what they dowhen they think no one is looking. You will see that animal nature is stillapparent in all of us. Soon at family dinners and happy hours youäó»ll seeŒæobvious animal tendencies in almost everyone you know.Do this with animals you see as well, and you will start will start seeing AuntGladys or your friend Mikeäó»s tendencies in the neighbors cat or a scavengingpigeon. This is what Ugly Animal Cards play on -Œæthe animal in us all.Historically, äóìfineäó pieces of art were placedin ornate, often gilded, frames to show that they deserved respect or possessedmore than what met the eye äóñ ugly monarchs, images of tulips, drips of paint. Inthese frames, they transcended what they physically were and became somethingof worth and contemplation. Animals in these frames were the high-bred steeds,well-groomed lap pets of royalty... never an old crippled goat.Œæ ŒæŒæYetan old goat, when examined, has an established personality, feelings,tendencies - a story - theyäó»reŒæmore than meets the eye.Why not put a gimp goat in a frame - the less than ideal is much moreinteresting than expected perfection. Animals are every bit as individualizedas humans.Anotherinspiration that added to the äóìuglyäó in Ugly Animal Cards, is how ourrelationship with animals or things we love changes ourŒæperceptionŒæof the physical. In reality, our oldone-eyed, obese pug probably smells and annoys others with its mouth breathing.But to us, the owners, theyäó»re nearly perfect - ever worthy of a gilded frame.UglyAnimal Cards are a refreshing twiston the long-loved, card-giving tradition. BesidesŒæenvironmental responsibility, their accessibility tothe public will help encourage curiosity and spread knowledge of the diverseanimal kingdom with little known facts, fascinating species and a gentleintroduction toŒæanimal issues. The fun, playfulcreature on the front invites further examination, while the message insert andfact on the back delivers easily and enjoyably absorbedŒæknowledge. We aim to include only the most interestingand engagingŒæfacts and messages so that reading eachcard is engaging and enjoyable. And in this way, enough interest is gained thateven usually bland or difficult issues can be mentioned without causingdisconnection... broadening the mind.CardFeaturesŒ‡Eco-Happy(Recycled paper, biodegradable)Œ‡Messagesleeve saves time while reducing pressures and stressŒ‡EducationalŒ‡Fascinating,inspires curiosity Œ‡OccasionFlexibilityŒæŒ‡High-qualityprint and feelŒ‡Frame-ableas art!Œ‡Engagingwebsite broadens uses and educatesŒ‡The Animal äóñ Each species is sketched, inked,watercolored, digitally drawn, color-layered and formatted for just the right""ugly"" look.Œ‡The Frame äóñFollowing research, eachisŒædesigned to reflect an aspect of the animaläó»s life, use,ŒæhistoryorŒæbehavior.

937," I've always had a passion for history, especially that of World War 2. It was a daring, innovative time that changed the world. Some amazing engineering feats were accomplished - from the swift Spitfire to the fearsome Tiger tank. With my passion for realistic technical drawings, I'd love to put the two together to create a photobook collection of 30 of the most amazing weapon systems of the war - as selected by my backers.Œæ Each drawing will be printed in high resolution, accompanied by a short write-up detailing the innovation and impact of the weapon. I'm estimating this project to take 8-10 weeks. And the funding will cover my costs of living and supplies used during this time. All the drawings will be done on 11""x14"" paper with graphite pencils. Throughout the project I'll be posting work in progress photos to keep you up to date! Here's a recent sample of my work - a car as much of my previous work is of cars and planes.I look forward to hearing your input and thank you in advance for your support! "

942," Hello,This is an art project. I plan on creating at least 2,000 portraits over the course of the next few months. This is not an easy task, so your patience will be needed. I am going to try and finish 2,000 portraits by July of 2015. In the event that this project becomes larger than expected, and I have more than 2,000 inquiries, the time of delivery will be a bit longer for those signing up after 2,000. Here are some details about the project/how to sign up:- Pay $1 to have a black and white portrait made using any picture you send me with one face in it ( I can also do a pet or baby portrait, as long as there is only one subject in the photo! ). I will use Faber-Castell markers/pens to create your drawing by hand on a high grade 9 x 12 inch paper. When I complete your drawing, I will send you a high quality digital copy.- Pay $3 to have a full colored portrait using any picture you send me with up to two faces in it. Same digital delivery rules apply as listed above.- Pay $10 to have your art shipped to you anywhere in the world.IMPORTANT NOTE: I will open a website where I will host all 2,000 portraits ( including more if I have more inquiries ) for the public to see. The website name will be updated in the future as I have yet to create it. All digital copies of your portrait will be both sent to you via email or message, and uploaded to the website.Below are some pieces I made showcasing the styles you can expect.Special shout out to my friends over at www.tagpro.ggŒæand www.reddit.com/r/tagproŒæfor inspiring me to go about doing this project.A little bit about me:I am a college student studying biology, pre-med, and biomedical engineering at NJIT. I play college level D2 ice hockey. I've been drawing ever since middle school, and have progressively gotten better. I'm good at playing guitar, and a few other instruments. I'm also a fantasy author working on a long novel._Why am I doing this?I have two main reasons for doing such a ridiculous project.1. I want to improve my art skills by forcing myself to work on as many different types of faces as possible, and this is one of the best ways.2. I would like to have money on the side to spend on more art materials such as acrylic paints, canvases, brushes, new mediums etc."
943," Controversial Cartoons aims to be risky, conversational illustrations designed to make viewers think, laugh or cry. Essentially taking any excuse to draw and reflect the insanity of the world in not so professionally skilled designs. The idea was first concocted when i found myself recently graduated yet still unable to find myself a job better than minimum wage on a zero hour contract. So I thought i would turn my angst into art(?) since my jam business was not successful, nor my beer business as I know not how to make either of these products. So instead of using my degree to mop up my tears and broken dreams, I am redefining my limits and abilities. Here are but a few of the examples of how I have been entertaining myself and hopefully yourselves:ŒæŒæIdeas may be as dumb as stupid word play that I find amusing (simple things, simple minds).ŒæOr a little more real-life based risque and touchy subjects.ŒæŒæOr a little of both.ŒæOr sometimes (a lot of the time) just completely off the bat, feel good images. But each should attempt to start a debate, no matter how trivial or seemingly unnecessary, (and yes it is a true fact that hummingbirds can eat eight times their own body weight a day).ŒæBut hopefully you will enjoy and support this project.ŒæAnd now new and improved styles and concept. If the old fashioned pencil and paper isn't for you, then maybe these vibrant pieces will be, introducing Kimpotamus Kardashian. Other saucy semi aquatic mammals to follow!"

949," Having had years of experience with the tarot, I am more than capable of conceptualizing a deck. Only trouble is... I can't draw. So, I need to hire an artist. And then find a publisher.Since the card designs I envision are relatively simple, I should be able to pay an artist to create a deck (according to my conceptual specifications) within a year's time.The four suits of the minor arcana will consist of Matches, Bowls, Doobies, and Bags.The twenty-three (as opposed to the traditional twenty-two) cards of the major arcana will be classified with names like Stoned, Visionary, and Secret Stash (to name but three).This should be a fun, lighthearted collectible of a deck that will still serve as an effective oracular device.In addition to the cards themselves, the deck will consist of a paperback guide outlining the unique interpretations of all seventy-nine cards, which I will write myself."

With this Kickstarter campaign I'm just hoping to hit two birds with one stone; get my name and work out there on a broader spectrum so you might see and appreciate what I do, and be able to afford the supplies to help my work look all the more professional, in this case by using digital media to keep my work clean and precise and offer new realms to my work (such as T-shirts and other products).

968," I work in the film business as a union member in the scenic department. You meet a lot of interesting people...most of them are former or, current practicing artists. The problem of course with attempting to practice your art form while maintaining employment is you inevitably are forced to make some sacrifice in either your art form or, your main source of income. We have the flexibility of being able to choose the jobs we work on in theory. We are freelance after all but, that choice comes with consequences regardless of the choice being made. Either you work more and have less time to focus on the passion that drives you or, you work less and sacrifice the capital required to fund that passion. The days of the starving artist are almost over...we work now - we have to. The struggle is still there though.I think everyone has some creative passion that drives them...I think you have to in order to thrive in our world, 'fit in' in our country, and be capable of appreciating and accepting the film, television, video games, vine videos, and endless sources of creative and innovative entertainment that we've all come to expect from our world. Even if we don't have the means of creating ourselves, all of us certainly find appreciation in the creation. It's a responsibility I believe, for us all to support that creativity. Whether we do so by enjoying the entertainment provided to us or, in this case investing in an artist who just wants to share something with another and create something worth mentioning. The reason I am looking for funding is so I can simply continue to create and hopefully inspire others to do the same with the success that comes from it. But, I NEED YOUR HELP! Your investment is fundamental to the success of this experiment.ŒæTo be totally clear in regards to what you'll be receiving...If you decide to pledge, after the funding period has closed, you then will have to send me a photo of a person of your choosing. After I verify your pledge, I will then take that photo and use it as a reference to draw a monster. It wont necessarily look like the photo or have all the elements in the photo but, I will try to capture your essence from the photo provided best I can and incorporate that into a monster/creepy thing. Thank you!"

Sometimes it was someone who influenced me, or they were in a movie or two that I really was captivated by their performance and stage persona. I am going to create illustration of high quality roughly 11 x 17 in charcoal, watercolor or acrylic. I will create various icons or you can select one you have in mind if you help me out!Why do we need your help?Unfortunately, Dave Dockery of RockStar Art's illustrations came to a halt in 2010. Like many people in America the last five years have been rough. We lost a lot including all my art supplies and every piece of art I ever created was burned up in a fire. It was tragic, but thankfully nobody was harmed. I had just photographed all my work just weeks before so I can show some early sketches of this idea.ŒæWhat type of art are we creating?The illustrations will be roughly 11 x 17 or a size similar to that so that it would be suitable for framing and large enough to adorn a wall nicely. The mediums I work in are: pencil, charcoal, ink, pastel, chalk, acrylic, and watercolors. I would either choose an icon to create and do it in the medium of my choosing, or if you are a rewards winner you may pick it.ŒæI have some names and if you have any ideas for an icon I would love to hear them. The names will be from the various decades of the 20th Century to include as many decades as I can and really could be an almost endless list of icons of the 20th Century such as Charlie Chaplin, Tex Ritter, Clark Cable, Judy Garland, James Dean, James Cagney, Johnny Carson, Marlon Brando, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jim Morrison, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, A Hank Williams, James Stewart, Madonna, Clint Eastwood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Kurt Cobain are just some of the ideas that I've come up with off the top of my head. I would be happy to take any orders from you and I am offering rewards for certain size donations.ŒæFriends, I need your help and support to create more art. It's what I do. I also am writing a few e-books, but this is so important to my creative life and to keep me active. My health is not very good, but I plan to keep fighting for as long as I can. I do have some drawbacks, but I hope that you will continue to support me and if for some reason you order something and there's any problems my wife will be happy to work out something to return the favor. We don't anticipate any such problems.ŒæThank You for your support and I look forward to sharing with you my creations, my babies, my world...the world of RockStar ART!For more information or to request certain illustrations, please contact Dave Dockery at Rock Star Art: rockstarinart@gmail.com"

975," Artist Liam Alexander is transitioning from illustrator to graphic designer, and the money will be used to buy a graphic computer, software, art supplies and a web designer. My Story:""I have always had a love for art and design. Whether I was producing it myself or it was produced by someone else. I've been drawing since I was little, one day my older brother, age 6 at the time, was finishing drawings from school. I, 2 years old at the time, asked if I could draw too. My brother said I was just a baby and babies canäó»t draw yet.ŒæI wasŒælittle upset, my Mom, my best supporter, said for him to humor me, she handed me a pencil and paper and to everyoneäó»s surprise my brother and I could draw very well. She knew I had skills when I won, at the age of 3, the Sir Galahad coloring contest. I had to color in front of the Judges for them to believe it first. When I was young, I saw myself having an art collection. I attempted to start an art dealer partnership, with two girls from my street and my brother. We cut out magazine pages and glued them to construction paper to sell them for 25 cents. My Mom still chuckles about that story, she was our biggest supporter, buyer, and backer. The human face fascinates me and I am obsessed with detail, but I was no prodigy, However, I did win 3 scholastic art awardsŒæall wer 9untitled0 one a pastel on colored paper bull head the other flowersŒæstill life. I also recall another charcoal on colored paper still-lifeŒæand one of them hung in the Library of Congress, in D.C, an untitled graphite on paper, self-portrait. I got distracted working as a carpenter, but one day I picked the pencil back up and my friends loved it. They encouraged me to share this and give back to the world. My cousin introduced me to commercial art and I hand painted a business sign for a car shop.But I really honed my skills in the last 9 yrs. I was pretty much self taught through workshops and tutorials until I got with a great Art Instructor, Lynnmarie Fye, with Hope Valley School SystemsŒæin Central Ohio. My story continues:This Art Instructor honed my talent in my Photorealism art techniques, they are in graphite, as you can see my artwork in this field in the opening video also,Œæthat is a form of altering the original which was in print, butŒæI made sure that when working on them that they mostly explode as my own work, because it was my techniques thatŒæI wanted to be seen. It is called Photorealism, yes that is a real category, it takes great time, focus and concentration to reproduce as realistic as possible the artwork I work on fo those who will pledge for their personal Graphite Portrait for Special Edition Pledgers.ŒæAlsoŒæto reproduce a special portrait or picture that was damaged and this is what people love about my work, it is extraordinary, and rare to master.

976," Hi! I'm Jay and I have spent my life as a commercial artist, illustrator, sign painter, and other stuff to pay the bills. I'm excited about this project because it combines my love of books and art. It will include the traditional looking bookplates, some very detailed and some simple designs like old woodcuts. There will be animals, bookplates suitable for kids, themes for scholarly types and themes for those who love mysteries, detective stories, weird monster zombie stuff, and history. I have about 50% of the drawings already done and I will add updates with peeks of new ones as the work progresses. The originals are mostly done with micron archival pens and brushes on acid-free paper. I paint commercial signs for a living, but this kind of work is fun and satisfying, and much nicer in the winter than working outside in the cold.Some of the reward levels include color bookplates. These designs are of my choice since color isn't always appropriate for every design. I feel confident Œæyou will be happy with the art pieces! ŒæIf the funding exceeds the minimum, I will add extra surprise goodies to each of the mailed rewards!I've experimented with different adhesion methods. My favorite is the glue sticks you can find at any office supply store. it's clean, quick, and cheap. The pre-gummed bookplates from the old days were messy, tended to curl, and frequently stuck together in humid weather. Some people will want to use these for art projects or even framing, so they come with no adhesive.Œæ"

Paul's incredible detail has brought this fantastic film poster to life and created not only a poster but a piece of art.We have plans to make this an ongoing partnership and want to give you film lovers, something to remember your favourite film by or to simply have a cool piece of art adorning your wall."

984," Your Environmental FootprintŒæThis may sound overly ambitious. Quite frankly it may come off as absurd, but we are looking to change the approach to environmental responsibility. Whether you believe in global warming or not, it is undeniable that in our commercial world, each one of us consumes resources and generates carbon emissions. Be that by driving, buying products, eating food, heating our homes, showering, or wiping our bums.ŒæThe reality is, that there ARE many legitimate challenges to being environmentally conscious. We can't all afford the latest large impact green tech like electric cars, LED lighting overhauls, new appliances, etc., and lifestyle changes like public transportation or carpooling may also be impractical given ourŒæschedulesŒæand families.ŒæThat said, we should all be responsibleŒæand make efforts to reduce, re-use, and recycle. But what happens when this isn't enough?ŒæOur solution on its surface is simple. We've all been taught to recycle, re-use, and reduce, but the reality is that we should also REPLENISH! It takes time and lots of innovation to cut back on our behaviors, but we can offset our environmental impact by replenishing everyday! We want to help make that rewarding as well! Here's how:1) We design awesome wearablesŒæand greeting cards;2) We plant trees for each reward;3) You are helping the environment! ŒæThe overarching concept is ""offset what you can't reduce"", and we want to make that as painless and routine as possible. Imagine if a majority of your existing purchasing needs, habits, and passions, could also contribute to offsetting emissions and supporting a healthy planet!ŒæWe pondered long and hard about how we can fulfill the equation of you doing something, getting something, and helping the planet. It just so happens that the holidays are around the corner and it also just so happens that greeting cards are still a mainstay of sharing our joy and thoughts with others! It's a given that we all also like swag!For each of the reward tiers we'll be planting trees. We plan on planting sugar maples and white spruce trees and these will be planted in partnership with conservation authorities across Canada. The planting will take place in Spring, 2015 and we will keep track of all trees planted and provide updates and pictures on our website as well as including a map of planting site!Each 5 trees over the course of their mature lifetime are able to offset approximately 1 tonne of carbon emissions, and it is estimated that in North America we each generate about 5 tonnes every year directly! There are also hundreds of thousands of acres of trees disappearing annually! Help make a difference! Replenish what you can't offset!To help entice you into planting trees, we are developing custom greeting cards that include artistic re-creations of some memorable and culturally iconic moments.ŒæThe digital cards will all be provided in high resolution suitable for a variety of sharing methods either as ecards, wallpapers, etc.ŒæJUMBO PRINTED CARDS: The jumbo greeting cards will be printed on 100% recycled matte finish paper. The inside/reverse will include a certificate of the trees planted with our ecocadet logo!Conceptually, we've been able to find manufacturers that produce some of the types of recycled wood swag we're looking to provide. We will need to submit our own designs and ensure that the products are all made from recycled wood.ŒæTHE BASE DESIGNS: We'll be providing you custom design USB, Shades, and aŒæWatch with our stains and engravings!ETCHINGS - We will be provided a custom engraving on the pieces which includes the EcoCadet badge and indication of the number of trees that you helped to plant! This will be engraved on various parts of the swag. On the watch this will likely be on the band, on the frames of the glasses near the temple, and on the face of the USB!CUSTOM DESIGN STAINS: We invented two new colors...which already exist as colors...but that wouldn't be as unique! Deep Woods Red & Pine Haven Green! We will incorporate these colours in each piece of swag. BTW we're from Canada Eh! So its colours not colors!Our grandiose ambitions have humble beginnings. We are professionals living in a metropolis, with Œæa passion for nature. Our story is about helping you make a positive environmental impact without the traditional challenges that you may encounter:1) Transparency: Knowing that your contributions, when you make them, are actually being applied toward the cause. We want to make that clear. First by planting trees on your behalf and reporting on where and when we planted them. Long term, this may involve developing specific habitats, planting crops to later harvest for communities/social services, and supporting key projects.2) Share-ability: Being able to share your contributions on behalf of others to encourage a greater change and awareness. We want you to be able to gift your support to others. To help spread the mentality and responsibility of environmental responsibility.Œæ3) Tokenism: As much as we may all want to donate, we all also work very hard for our money, so an exchange that leaves both parties with a gain is preferred. You could argue that this is the fundamental cultural challenge, but again we are looking to making environment responsibility a more transnational process, which requires some mutual exchange. So, we want you to feel that you are getting some really nifty items including wearables and tech, for your efforts while still offsetting your impact.4) Complexity: It shouldn't be difficult to offset your environmental impact or to support an environmental cause. In fact, it should be silly simple. We want to establish a simple yet comprehensive platform.5) Efficiency: Each year thousands of companies and charities spend millions if not collective billions on eco projects. Their efforts are treasured, though arguably fragmented which by its very virtue results in a loss of efficiency. We aspire to develop a more cohesive and collaborative space for environmental initiatives.So to be clear, our story isn't about advocating living off the grid, or constantly upgrading your home to more efficient lighting, or developing carpooling plans that don't fit your schedule. If you can do those things, we encourage it! But our approach is more about 'offsetting' your impact.Œæ"
985," We are just two dudes with a idea to bring people hilarious and awesome merchandise to the masses, some of it one of a kind. It started out as a Facebook page that made not very flattering profile pictures for people, then more and more people asked for them and it just grew bigger and bigger to a point were we can make some money of it though other means like shirts mouse mats and anything that can be be printed on. We didn't set out to try and make money of this at first but when more and more people wanted what we got, that's when the light bulb moment came. We both have jobs and we do this in our spare time and would love this to be what we do with the rest of our life's, so that's why we need money to start to get better merchandise like shirts, mouse mats, calendars, pens you name it. We have started to make up portraits from films TV and music to appeal to people that would like something different of there most favorite character or singer. We are the type of people that like to give back to the customers and people that support us in doing monthly giveaways on Facebook of shirts or calenders of some other merchandise just to say thanks.

986," Hello, my name is Jeff and Im an artist, designer and all-around maker from Duluth, Minnesota. I have a love of vintage advertising and design. I especially enjoy fruit crate labels and a while back I started to dabble with an idea that uses these labels as inspiration for a line of illustrations I call The Duluth Crate Co. Duluth, Minnesota and the north shore of Lake Superior is a special place. There are many things to see and do and the region also has a grand history that spans over a century in the building of America. Being an inland port, Duluth welcomes ships from all over via the Great Lakes where it takes iron ore, grain and other raw materials to places all around the world. Duluth is a major tourist destination as people love the history, arts scene and overall beauty of the region. Because there are so many things to see, learn about and do, these places in and around Duluth became subject matter for my line of illustrations that make these places into a äóìbrandäó on the side of a fruit crate. What started with a handful of experiments has grown into a current line of 35 prints of Duluth and North Shore inspired prints.ŒæThe Duluth Crate Co. has been in local gift shops, galleries and art fairs offering different sized prints, framed prints, mugs and other types of dí©cor and products. Currently, they are only being sold online at duluthcrateco.com.Where you and Kickstarter comes in.After local success and much learning, dreaming and more dreaming, it is time to branch out and start offering these prints in the likeness of special places from all over the United States. The American Collection will eventually have many places from each state and will be continually added to the offering as they are finished. As of right now, there are 20+ new prints of places from around the USA (Some states have more than one right now). This initial offering will be at least one print from each state and more to be added over time. What I need is help with printing the initial offering of my 8x10, 11x14 and notecards for each place. Right now Im basing my offering off a printing of 50 each of the print sizes and notecards per place which equates to over 7500 pieces!Below is a list of the planned places for this initial line. As I finish up the remaining illustrations to round out the initial line, I will announce the new images on the Duluth Crate Co. blog, the email newsletter and shared on social media.--------------------------------------FacebookŒæ| Twitter | Instagram---------------------------------------Alabama äóñ Russel Cave National MonumentAlaska äóñ Mt McKinley, Denali National ParkArizona äóñ Grand CanyonArkansas äóñ Ozark Folk CenterCalifornia äóñ Golden Gate BridgeColorado äóñ Mesa VerdeConnecticut äóñ Mystic SeaportDelaware äóñ Brandywine ValleyFlorida äóñ Kennedy Space CenterGeorgia äóñ Okefenokee SwampHawaii äóñ Pearl HarborIdaho äóñ Sun ValleyIllinois äóñ Willis TowerIndiana äóñ Indianapolis Motor SpeedwayIowa äóñ Lake OkobojiKansas äóñ Dodge CityKentucky äóñ Kentucky DerbyLouisiana äóñ Natchez SteamboatMaine äóñ Acadia National ParkMaryland äóñ Fort McHenryMassachusetts äóñ Plymouth RockMichigan äóñ Mackinac IslandMinnesota äóñ Split Rock LighthouseMississippi äóñ Vicksburg National Military ParkMissouri äóñ Gateway ArchMontana äóñ Glacier National ParkNebraska äóñ Chimney RockNevada äóñ Hoover DamNew Hampshire äóñ Mt.

The coloring book will be roughly 60 pages long, with 25 original black & white illustrations depicting scenes of rock star antics, such as: Ozzy bites the head off a bat, Keith Moon blows up toilets, moments of Phil Spector craziness and lots more. The pages opposite of the illustrations will feature the story behind these infamous moments. There will be a ""Thank You"" page, Table Of Contents, and other standard pages. Like the project image above, the book will be somewhat adult-themed, so you may want to reserve it for your friends and keep it away from the young kids.The money being raised for this book will be going toward the legal and publishing costs, getting an ISBN, the first printing costs, and other various costs related to publishing the book. I have done two other coloring books on Kickstarter, so I am using the budgets from the previous projects as a guideline for this one. The only difference is this time I will be using an artist to create the illustrations instead of myself, so the budget is a little higher, but the quality should be better as well.If you'd like to see examples of my other coloring book projects you can check them out by clicking on the below image or link to my website.http://www.clecoloringbook.com/Thanks for looking! Help me make this thing happen!"
989," Where it all beganMy Visionarium was born from many nights of trying to help our little people get to sleep when they couldn't settle their mind. Sometimes active imaginations, troubles of the day or a busy lifestyle can make it hard for children to relax. Gone are the lazy days where children are free to daydream and pretend. Let's bring back the magic of childhood with this beautiful and unique product. Suitable for all ages, abilities and interests. My Visionarium will take you wherever you want it to.What is My VisionariumA pack of 21 circular cards, approx 19cm in diameter. Each card portrays a different scene...some realistic and some fantasy. The scenes are created with beautiful illustrations, designed to help children explore their imaginations. The reverse of each card explains activities that parents or caregivers may like to use to prompt their child to create their own version of the scene. Included within each scene are hidden treasures to be found. Some are easy and some are hard, but each one appears just once on every card.ŒæSuitable for use when its bedtime, waiting for appointments, stays in hospital or during quiet time.ŒæCards will come beautifully packaged for easy travel and will include an information card to explain their different uses.Œæ"

991," As a group of avid basketball fans, we are embarking on a mission to illustrate the complete history of every single professional basketball team. Since we are a group of loyal Chicagoans, we are starting (day 1) with The Chicago Bulls Tree and will continue to release a new design concept from a different team each day. We are looking to appeal to all basketball fans. We know you love your team, your city and have fond memories of the stars of your childhood. Now, you can relive every moment with a Burton History Tree of your favorite basketball team.Our very first basketball tree will be for the Chicago Bulls. It is a striking visual collage of the legendary NBA franchise and a beautiful piece of art doubling as a chronology of the Chicago Bulls organization. Depicting over 250 players, 44 Hall of Famers, 6 world championships, and countless elements of Bulls lore, this tree provides a comprehensive display of the Chicago Bulls entire history. Each player and achievement in the tree, from Jerry Sloan and his fellow team pioneers to Air Jordan and the äóÖ90äó»s Bulls dynasty, is arranged in chronological order and sized by significance, with multiple fonts by position. Relevant historical images are included to bring your team to life. ŒæEach tree has a corresponding 'key', allowing you to easily understand the science behind this artistic revelation.Burton History Trees are one-page history books. They are beautiful, engrossing, easy-to-grasp illustrations that encapsulate the history of an entire sports franchise or musical genre in single vibrant images.Burton History Trees bring the history of your favorite sports team or musical era to life. The content of each tree is uniquely arranged in chronological order and sized by significance.The the story is told from the beginning to end, without turning pages.By combining names, images, and sketches, Burton creates a one of a kind piece of art that is the ideal conversation piece.A Burton History Tree is the perfect gift for any sports or music enthusiast.ŒæViewing The TreesRoots: City skylines, stadiums and other architectural elements that make up the franchise. ŒæTrunk: The individuals or teams that proceeded the current franchise chronologically or geographically and would influence the future of that team.Foliage:ŒæEvery player that ever played for the team. ŒæThe size is the number of games played and the font is their position with the team.In 1978, when Bruce Burton wasfrustrated by the lack of information available on British rock, he had a suddenflash of genius: use the traditional family tree format to create the historyof his favorite musical genre. Bruce was obsessed with musical history and howbands influenced each other. He typographically coalesced the names of hundredsof British bands, along with a wealth of drawings and icons into onepicturesque illustration of a tree. Popping with different sizes and fonts, theband names moved chronologically from older bands at the the bottom of the treeto newer bands near the top. Through considerable research, he found a way tochronologically link the musicians who gave birth to the genre and ultimately led to some of Britain's greatest rock music. The treeexpressed the legacy of British rock in dazzling visual form. This was 1978 andno one had seen anything like it before. Everyone Bruce showed it to lovedit. He found a way to reproduce his tree onto lithographic prints and a newart form was created - The Burton History Tree.For the next thirty years,Bruce was driven by his insatiable love for music and sports and he continued toconstruct his trees entirely by hand, spending a painstaking 6-18 months pertitle. In 2007, Eric Fine - a fan of Bruceäó»s art sincechildhood - approached Bruce with the idea of digitally producing a tree usingmodern technology. Bruce loved the idea. In 2008, Eric and Bruce alongwith fellow graphical artist Drew Wasserman, founded the new BurtonHistory Trees, LLC.The Chicago Bulls History Tree is the first product of our Kickstarter. Each day we will update you with designs of a new franchise from the rest of the 29 professional teams.Œæ Your pledge will help provide the resources we need to invest in production, distribution, and licensing of this line from NBA Properties, the intellectual property holder for the National Basketball Association, their Player's Association and their retired player's association, Legends of Basketball.Shortly after this Kickstarter ends, we will be exhibiting in the Sports Licensing and Tailgate Show in Las Vegas. We hope to connect with other leagues, franchises and universities to create Burton History Trees of their own while we are there.Œæ Our goal is to bring this artform into the limelight and partner with bodies like the NBA in what should become long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships.Œæ Effective 12/30/2014, we will offer any of the music trees currently in print and offered for sale on our website, BurtonHistoryTrees.com.Œæ Assuming we prevail with our funding goal, all backers will receive a survey through Kickstarter to get more information on the specific titles you would like and the format (shirt size, etc.) -- at this time you can select any of the 30 Pro Basketball Teams or anything else in our portfolio.ŒæUpon successful funding of this project, and assuming continued, safe growth for our company and pending design studio we plan on being able to complete the rest of the major professional sports leagues and division I universities by end of year 2016. ŒæIn the meantime, if you would like for us to create your team's tree sooner, that is what the $2500 custom tree option is for. ŒæThe $2500 reward provides a great gift for your university or a great fundraiser for your non-profit or civic organization. ŒæWe are happy to make those for teams near and far, but in the event a mass market exists (i.e., Manchester United, Dallas Cowboys) we are able to produce one for the $2500 -- prints and reprints, etc. may require time while our legal team secures the proper licensing for all involved such that we can work together to bring those products to light."
992," Hi,I'm Rik Pattenden and I am a pen and ink artist from Hampshire, England. All of my work is hand drawn and you can see some more on my website, chaosworks.co.ukI am looking for funding to produce and distribute a 13 page calendar for 2015, using the first twelve of my 'single line' pen and ink drawings (see below). I feel that crowd funding is ideal for producing calendars as they have a sell by and use by date. This way, only as many as are required would be printed.Limited edition, signed calendars will be exclusive to this Kickstarter project and not available anywhere else! The calendar would be A3 size (300mm x 420mm) and printed on 200gsm gloss stock. Each one to be signed by me on the front cover and delivered in time for Christmas. I began this series last Summer and it took me a little over 6 months to complete this first twelve. Each original drawing measures 48cm x 48cm.Each picture is a single line with a beginning and end. At no point does the line cross itself. Hours of fun can be had trying to find all the ends and my initials, R.A.P, which also appear within each picture!Some things you may not notice right away but you'll have a month to study each one!This first twelve in the series are all based around ideas of contrast and relationships.Full size, signed lithographic prints are available as Kickstarter rewards or through my website.ŒæOriginally this was just going to be a set of twelve but has now become an ongoing series, the next instalments to be released later this year. Please do not hesitate to contact me, should you have any questions.Thank you for your interest."

995,"  Frank's Adventures tells the tall tales of a short dog as he gets lost in the woods and, in the process, finds his place in the world. It's a heart-warming story of adventure, family and home, perfect for adults and children alike.Meet Frank. He's a two year old Chihuahua mix. He likes long walks, treats, napping, and a rousing game of tug-of-war. Frank is also an experienced adventurer.I was fostering Frank for Sugar Mutts RescueŒæwhen he ran off one day on a road trip into the woodsy Catskills area of upstate New York. Frank was lost in those woods, which are filled with deer and wild turkeys and foxes for an entire week. We searched everywhere for him, combing the woods, putting up signs in local towns, and enlisting the help of internet communities. After a very long week, I received a call saying Frank had been found! He'd wandered up to someone's porch and sat down, a little fatter and none the worse for wear, ready to go home. As soon as I saw him again and watched him wiggle his way into my arms, I knew I was keeping him forever.ŒæSince then, I've been listening to Frank tell his stories about adventuring and exploration. I don't know how much of it is true and how much is embellished, but he tells a pretty good story so you're sure to enjoy it. That's why I decided to write it down for him and illustrate it. The underlying message of the story is about finding your place in the world. Through the story of Frank's adventures, the ideas of foster care and adoption (applicable to both dogs and children) are handled with a gentle sense of humor. Directed primarily at children aged 4-7, it's a fun read accompanied by beautiful images and a heartwarming message for kids and adults of all ages.ŒæThank you for your help in bringing Frank's Adventures to life!https://www.facebook.com/FranksAdventuresBookFor your generous donations, you will get one or more of the following:"

1000," Even though I retired from pastoral ministry 16 years ago to become a family therapist (click here), my 23 years of parish work as an ordained clergy person left an indelible appreciation in me for what pastors do. During my time as a pastor I sold hundreds of gag cartoons to Leadership Journal, Christianity Today, Youth Worker Journal, and dozens of other publications. This 84 page book contains over 300 of the best of the lot.My goal is to raise funds to print this item and give copies to the 60 pastors I know in Whatcom County, Washington. As Blanche Dubois said in A Streetcar Named Desire, ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,"" This book will be my (our!) gift to them for the often thankless work they do in offering emotional and spiritual support for strangers, both churched and unchurched alike. My comic art gets rave reviews and here for the first time we'll have the best of the best gag cartoons between two covers.My incentive to recruit large donors ($100) will be a hand drawn caricature of you using photos that you provide.

1001," I-MICE 7 uses original art and literature as tools to make good character and moral principle culturally relevant and culturally understood.  I-MICE 7 involves the creation of 7 new books and 105 new pieces of art that are stimulating, provoking and geared to build good character.  The youth will be intimately involved in this creative process.Good Day to All of You,We are TripGear Character Navigation.  We work with a broad spectrum of learners teaching and encouraging them to be of good moral and principle, and we do it through original art & literature.We're not satisfied with our kids being intelligent and JERKS!  We want our students to makes those äóìAäó»säó while also at the same time understanding that those Aäó»s wonäó»t give them hugs at the end of a lonely night.  What about those äóìCäó students?  We believe that if it comes to the choice of either being an A student or an upstanding person of character, well, good character wins the day.  Without good character, a smart and sophisticated man or woman (in the traditional sense) is a smart and sophisticated criminal.This is why we're asking you to partner with us in this spectacular exhibit of both art and literature that we call I-MICE 7.  Help us help others become emotionally and morally intelligent.What is I-MICE? I-MICE (Image, Metaphoric, Inspirational, Character, Encourager.)In short, I-MICE is the name given to all the art we create.  Every piece has the express purpose of imparting some lesson or commentary about society, people, violence and a host of other topics.  These symbolic illustrations (I-M.I.C.E.) are geared to evoke a visceral response from the viewer. This all-original art contains subject matter that is both culturally familiar and thought provoking, pushing viewers to contemplate just how they relate to the scene while exercising their mind to find the deeper meaning in the art. It provides learners an opportunity to reassess their own character flaws and build the character traits needed to resist negative influences.  I-MICE themes include: community, domestic abuse, anger, bullying,education, relationships, gang indoctrination, drugs and more. About the äóÖ7äó» in the name, I-MICE 7: The äóÖsevenäó» refers to the seven new illustrated books we are assembling during the course of this project. The stories are already written.  It is now a matter of editing and publishing them in physical and digital formats; this is the portion we need your help in.Every book we create is illustrated (with I-MICE) and teaches a lesson in building moral character and resisting the forces that seek to keep us in bondage.  The 105 I-MICE pieces created through this KickStarter will be divided across these 7 new books as story illustrations.The literature and the Art both work off each other.  We find that even learners that abhor reading are drawn into the literature by the I-MICE art.  The art poses a question, äóìWhat does this mean?äó  The literature provides a more concise answer.  The art compels students to read for that answer!Students as Creators! Though TripGear will bring I-MICE to life, our students will be the concept creators, establishing the concepts for 50% of the art.  Now, not only will students derive value from observing I-MICE art, but they will place a more personal stake into the art as they create concepts for other people to be enriched by. It makes a difference when the learner creates something.  It is magic to see the look on their faces when their imagination comes to life as a physical product. Thereäó»s a sense of pride they gain.  Theyäó»ve become more than consumers that take.  Now, they give.With I-MICE 7, our youth will exercise giving value to the world äóñ quite literally.The Product äóñ Whoäó»s it For? The 7 new books and the 105 I-MICE are for everyone.  Up until now, we have spoken to the use of these materials with school students, but these product donäó»t only appeal to the young; it appeals to the full-grown adult as well.  It is our experience that I-MICE art causes the same curiosity and awe in adults that it does in young peoples. One of the main end-goals of this KickStarter is to place I-MICE art and stories into more classrooms while making it all available to the open public as well.  Weäó»re looking to change lives both inside and outside the classroom.  Upon project completion, I-MICE art and literature will be made available for sale online at: http://tripgear.org/index.php/m-storeWhy TripGear is Capable of Accomplishing This Task Weäó»ve done this all before but on a much smaller scale and at a much slower pace.  As a small committed staff, over the past 4 years, weäó»ve created over a 100 pieces of I-MICE Art and have self-published 7 books (Art of the Close, Jack Gun, Night before Xmas, Leo the Lion, Blackenstein, Trip volume I and II).  Weäó»ve been implementing I-MICE to great success in learning intuitions for just as long, so this is not an experiment. I-MICE works and compels some of the most distracted of youth to pause and reassess their life choices. Financing has been our chiefest obstacle in making the books and I-MICE Art widely available to students and the public.  We already have the stories; theyäó»re complete. We already have the capable people in place to make I-MICE art a reality.  We need your support to kick this operation into overdrive. Letäó»s make life-changing, perception altering art and books available to more people and at an even higher quality and polish than it already possesses.The Breakdown: ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ  I-MICE 7 äóñ Over 100 pieces of I-M.I.C.E. art spread across 7 new books.		1) We are assembling 7 new books.			äó¢ The stories comprising these books are already written.			äó¢ The books need to be edited.			äó¢ Books will be formatted as paperbacks and eBooks.Œæ			äó¢ (scroll down to view the book titles and book synopses)2) The creation of 105 new I-M.I.C.E. illustrations.			äó¢ The 105 I-MICE will be divided evenly across the 7 books (Roughly 15 I-MICE 					per book) serving as story illustrations.			äó¢ The 105 I-MICE also serve as stand-alone images to be used in a variety of 					ways including exhibitions. 3) Students as Concept Creators.äó¢ Our students will be the Concept Creators, establishing the concepts for 50% 					of the art.			äó¢ Now, not only will students derive value from observing I-MICE, but they will 					place a more personal stake into the art as they create concepts for 					other people to be enriched by. 4) Availability to the world.			äó¢ All of this effort will make both I-MICE and the 7 new books available to the 					open public.

1004," The ""Phoenix"" was my first complete drawing in this style. It resembles my revival as an artist. I created it during a huge transition in my life and hope it makes a positive impact on others. Some view it as a peacock, some a phoenix. Either way, it is what YOU feel it is. It's the same with all my art in this style. It is designed to be interpreted by the viewer.ŒæBy pledging to this project you are helping an artist start her career.ŒæThe goal with this project is to help cover the cost of printing art, as well as to get this unique style of art out into the world. All money earned beyond the printing costs will go toward the time involved in creating the art, as well as living expenses. This project is the first step toward my goal of returning to school for a Master's Degree in Psychology for Art Therapy.ŒæThe ""Seahorse"" was my second drawing in this style. It was an experimental drawing that allowed me to try entirely new drawing techniques, as well as various styles within the same drawing.ŒæThe ""Prehistoric Squid"" was another experimental drawing as well as a meditation drawing. The repeating shapes and stipples allowed me to reflect on life while I focused on the drawing. It allowed my brain to wander and think about the world we live in. I was inspired by fossils, marine life, and spirals, so I combined them into this abstract creature.Œæ""Bird of Flowers"" was my first attempt with detailed, stylized branches. I hope to use this style in later drawings within this series. This drawing is another that is difficult to decide what type of bird it is. I started with a crow in mind, but it morphed into this final image.Œæ""Sea Turtles"" was my fifth drawing in the series. I started using some new shading techniques and blur affects within the stipples of this one. I also added a combination of coral, kelp, and bubbles to create movement and depth within the drawing.""Paisley Fish"" is the latest drawing within this series. I was inspired by paisley patterns, beta fish, and a balance of male/female shapes. This drawing is still in progress, but will be complete by the end of this project's funding duration. This one has been, by far, the most complicated and time consuming of the series, but I feel the time has been worth it. It has been a very therapeutic drawing with all the repetitive shapes, added depth, and patterns.REWARD INFORMATION:Kickstarter edition prints: 11"" x 17"" prints on 80lb cardstock with a kickstarter edition watermark on the bottom left along with the print number, artist signature, and date.Special edition print sets: 11"" x 17"" prints on a custom, tinted paper to create a vintage ink look (will post an example soon!). Each print will have a watermark on the bottom left along with the print number, artist signature, and date.Only three of the original are still available and are being offered as rewards for pledging to this project.ŒæI have plans for more drawings within this series. Future drawings will include dolphins, an octopus, monarch butterflies, and any others that come to mind along the way. Feel free to follow my website, facebook, or twitter account for more information throughout the length of this project.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"

We believe that the key to creating innovative and world class design solutions for our clients is keeping ourselves constantly inspired and learning. To this end, we've developed a series of internal studio projects which we've dubbed 'love projects'.ŒæThe most prolific of these projects is our series of illustrated first edition book spines. It all started when we discovered the beautiful cover art that Vanessa Bell created for the first editions ofŒæher sister Virginia Wolf's novels. We took a particular liking to the spines, which are usually overlooked, but in this case stand tall on their own merit.These sweet and quirky spines seemed under appreciated to us, so we decided to do something about it. Our illustrative re-creations shine a spotlight on Bell's original artwork, giving them a new life.If you're interested we also work in areas such asŒælogo design,Œædigital strategy,ŒæbrandingŒæand web development.Œæ"

1011," My name is Ken Handley and Iäó»m a freelance graphic design artworker by trade with over 20 years in the industry. My job entails using the Adobe graphic software - Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator of which Iäó»ve used since my university days.ŒæMy mastering of this software has helped me develop a style to create highly detailed illustrations using Adobe Illustrator. This software is vector based, what this means is that when you draw a shape, no matter how large you scale it up, unlike a photograph or Photoshop produced work, it retains itäó»s edge, so what you see in my samples given would look exactly the same if blown up the size of a football pitch- this to me is what my style is about- my canvas if you like is my Apple Mac and Adobe Illustrator is my brush.What I do is take photographs - in this case- vintage Vespas and Lambrettas. They have to be crisp photographs in which I may only find a few out of several taken as the right photos to use. I then reproduce those photos in illustrator often painstakingly tracing over individual pixels and using my judgement to re-create the light reflecting off these surfaces so that chrome looks like chrome, plastic looks like plastic and glass looks like glass.I have recently finished illustrating a Vespa-The time taken to do this was equivalent to working 3 months full time hours. The detail was quite pain-staking, please see the following images to get an idea of the detail.-ŒæThe next illustration I'm working on is a Lambretta that is covered in lots of head lamps, this is the photo-ŒæAs you can see there's lots of lamps to illustrate! This is my progress so far-ŒæHere's the lamps up close, you can see the detail in them. I estimate 3 months solid hard work to complete them."
1012," Hi, John is my husband he is an awesome artist. He works a full time job as a bricklayer for 25 years. For now he works 10 hours a day 6 days a week. When he comes home he draws for about 2 hours a day. He has hundreds of different kinds of drawings. He has a unique type of drawing almost like Picasso. I think many people would like this type of art. I showed him this site today and he said sure put me on. This is all he would love to do. As a child he wanted to be an architect but we all know how life gets away from us. I wanted to do this for him as a gift of his great talent. I also gave him water colors and what he did with them was quite amazing. I am not sure he knows how truly amazing the water colors turned out. I think he has a real place in art with a type people desire. The funds will be used for paper, pencils, envelopes, stamps, frames, and of course his time. He can pull it off because this is ALL he does that part will be simple. I named it John's World because you are about to enter the mind of Johns world. Enjoy. "
1013," As a tattooist and fine artist based in Austin Tx, I spend much of my free time working in other mediums outside of tattooing. I generally prefer working on natural subject matter with an illustrative approach.My Chameleon was one of my first illustrations in exploring this creative preference of design. Through this exploration, my Chameleon came to life a little over two years ago and has since become my branding image scene on my portfolio, business cards, and other outlets. The follow up to this series is a sugar glider named ""Luna"". A creative interpretation on my nocturnal companion who often spends time with me at the drawing table.I am frequently approached by art enthusiasts wanting to own these for themselves. As a very personal project, I haven't felt quite comfortable letting the originals of these go. Many people, especially in the tattoo community, often ask for prints which is what led me to Kickstarter. I simply wanted a way to affordably supply anyone with an interest, the option to have a very high quality print to frame, hang, and call their own.ŒæI have spent a lot of time preparing the digital files, and working with a local company in bringing forth something enjoyable, possibly more so than the originals themselves. I'm hoping the outcome may surpass expectations.ŒæThank you for your support in the art community and backing my project!"

1015," The purpose of my project is to help share my art with the world. My passion is drawing and more specifically drawing today's most influential media to me such as Movie/ TV Character's and also music album cover's. I had the drive to draw when I was younger, however over the years I became busy with work, school, and other life plans, that I lost my passion to draw. However over the past year I have rediscovered that old dream and have decided that I want to make a career out of it. Therefore my project is to create a better established website, gain a better knowledge and more skills in the art field, as well as share my art with the world by branching out in the art community. I plan to achieve this through taking art courses at the University of Missouri starting Spring of 2015, practicing, and also contributing my hard work and dedication. Although there may be some times that I fail, I want to strive for my absolute best in making this dream become a reality."
1016," The calendar features an extensivecollection of artwork depicting the most infamous serial killers in the world.Œæ Deemed too controversial for retail sales, the arresting images were created by some ofthe worldäó»s most talented true crime artists.In addition to the evocativeart, the calendar includes extensive information about the human monsters that are depicted within.Œæ It is the kind of gruesome stuff that the BAU from""Criminal Minds"" would dissect.ŒæThe artists featured include: Chad O'Connell, Chuck Hodi, Erick Diaz, Gerald Torbitt, Jack Malebranche, Johnny Machine, Nate Milliner, Nicholas Raimo, Nicolas Castelaux, Pete Berg, Rowan Andrews and Uriel A. Duran.The concept for a serialkiller calendar was born from our collaborative friendship,when we were students at the University of Maine at Orono. ŒæWe decided to secure the rights to paintingsdone by Nico Claux.Œæ Dubbed The Vampire of Paris, Claux was notoriousin Paris for his appetite for human flesh.ŒæŒæClaux began painting in aParisian prison while serving time for murder.ŒæArt was his vehicle for rehabilitation and personal growth.TheSon of Sam laws, designed to keep criminals from profiting from the publicity oftheir crimes, prevented Claux from selling his art in the U.S.Œæ We decided to bring his artwork to thepublic. After much debate, we agreed that a calendar would be the best formatto curate the art. We created the original calendar in 2007.ŒæŒæDespite receiving great fanfare for the calendar on the Internet, we were turned down by every major retailer because the content was deemed too controversial.ŒæŒæThe calendar was covered by Reuters and the AP and the producers of Law and Order SVU invited us on set.ŒæBased on the fan reception to the first calendar, we decided to create a much more ambitious calendar for 2008.ŒæŒæWe were fortunate to have renowned authors and artists contribute their work.ŒæŒæWe made a deal with Hot Topic and they ordered calendars for 300 of their locations. We expanded by creating The Serial Killer Magazine.ŒæŒæWe were able to secure an agent in Los Angeles who got us a distribution deal with Borders and Barnes and Noble.ŒæJust when it appeared that we had finally made it, everything fell apart.ŒæŒæHot Topic rescinded their order, claiming that it was still too controversial.ŒæŒæOur agentäó»s deal required that we front all of money for printing costs and would only be repaid nine plus months later once all of the merchandise was sold.ŒæŒæBeing two college students (in the pre-crowdfunding era) we couldnäó»t make this work financially and were forced to set aside our dream get äóìreal jobsäó.ŒæTheŒæemergenceŒæof crowdfundingmakes it possible for us to revisit the Serial KillerŒæCalendar.Œæ No longer are creators beholden to theeditorial whims and price margins of massive retail corporations.Œæ The 2015 calendar is our best work to dateand we cannot wait to bring it directly to you!ŒæWith the support of the Kickstarter community, we are looking to raise enoughmoney to meet the printing companyäó»s minimum order quantity.Œæ We can then bring the calendar directly tofans without any gatekeepers censoring the art and driving up the price.If the project issuccessful, we will continue to create original content and hope to create acommunity on our website www.SerialKillerCalendar.com.ŒæŒæThe Rewards:"

1020," Hello :) Thank you for stopping by!This KickStarter project is aimed at helping me begin selling prints of original ink drawings(original size: A4) of landscapes from my homeland of Goa on the west coast of India. I would also draw and sell original work on request.The ultimate aim of a (hopefully!:))successful project is to raise funds to set up a self-financing reforestation programme and a general clean-up of polluted and biologically significant areas of urban and rural Goa. It will involve anyone who wishes to preserve what is left of the natural environment of this planet and living in or travelling to, Goa.ŒæThe first step will begin with guided bicycle rides and walks into the non-built up areas around the heavily populated coastal region of Goa. This aims to highlight 'urban' non-human biological life, including many migratory species of birds, endemic primates and other animals and plant life that face extinction.ŒæProgressive steps will involve 6-12 hour expeditions further inland and later, 2-3 day long camping trips. Eventually I hope to have established a self-sustaining programme of activities that are sensitive to the environment and sales of which will actively help preserve the biological diversity of the region.

1025," This project has no commercial background but is purely cultural.We are heading to print a book ( art-catalogue ) on the lifes work of german artist Uwe Groíô who died in 2013 at only age 50.

As a child Uwe Groíô (born in 1963) already felt that he was born to draw and paint. After high school he gave in to his fathers' wishes that he learn a 'real' profession and joined the school for industrial design (www.hfg-offenbach.de). However, it felt wrong to him and he was unhappy. He quit industrial design and applied to study at the international famous University of Art Stí_delschule in Frankfurt am Main, Germany (www.staedelschule.de). The first time he applied to the Stí_delschule, he was rejected, so he took on a job as a taxi driver. During his time as a taxi driver he continued to work on improving his painting style. One year later, he attempted his second application to the Stí_delschule and was rejected once again. Nevertheless he was determined to study there and while continuing his taxi job, applied for entry a third time one year later. This time, Jí_rg Immendorff (de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jí_rg_Immendorf)was a new professor at the Stí_delschule and recognized his talent and accepted him into his class. Uwe studied with Immendorff from 1989 until 1995 and graduated from the academy as Immendorffs' first master student.To offset the age old problem of making a living as a young artist, Uwe took an odd job as what he called a 'waterman'; delivering the giant communal water bottles to high-rise office buildings in Frankfurts commercial district. He worked all day, then drove his bicycle to a shared studio and painted till late at night. Surviving on very little sleep, he followed this schedule for almost 20 years. During these years he created hundreds of wonderful and stunning pieces of art and had many exhibitions, but never quit his job as 'waterman'. Most of the people for whom he delivered water never knew who this kind, gentle and hardworking man was in reality.Uwe joined me on a short trip to the Biennale of Art in Venice, Italy on his 50th birthday in fall 2013. He collapsed with an extremely high fever the day we arrived and had to be taken back to Frankfurt and straight into hospital. There he was examined repeatedly, but the fever did not go away and the doctors did not find the cause. They sent him home in a weak condition after 4 weeks. Two days later, his physician send him back to the hospital. This time to the university hospital with the best modern facilities. After another 2 weeks of often very painful examinations and in a very bad condition they found out that he was suffering from lymphomic cancer, which had already weakened his immune system to a dangerous level. The doctors allowed him home for 2 days to settle a few things before he returned for a planned chemo therapy treatment. I took him to the ward, and that was the last time I saw him. The doctors told him, that he probably had a severe infection which they could not locate and they were going to put him into an artifical coma and wake him up after about 6 days when his body would be stronger again. A few days later, still in coma, he died of multiple organ failure, exactly 2 months after his 50th birthday.Uwe left behind a huge heritage of art to the world. We, a group of close friends, want to fulfill his life goal to give his art to the world. The paintings and sculptures should be exhibited and made visible to as many people as possible to give them joy and inspiration. We are going to exhibit the life work of Uwe Groíô on a larger scale. The first exhibition in 2015 will take place in Frankfurt am Main, Germany at the new location 'Honselbridge' at Kunstverein Familie Montez ( look for pictures and informations on Kunstverein Familie Montez on google ). Everybody involved with this project; photographer, graphic designer, handymen, ect. has agreed to work free of charge. However, we still need to cover the printing costs of approximate USD $12.500 for a hardcover catalogue on Uwes' complete body of artwork. Kunstverein Familie Montez has agreed to sell those catalogues during and after the exhibition which should help to cover part of their expenses. Please consider supporting our work and making this very important project possible !If you wish to get a small glimpse of Uwe Groíô at work in his studio in 2010, follow this link ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfTjfZciiFw )Many thanks in advance to all for your generous contributions.KrisArtists biography1963 born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany1981-1984 study of industrial design at the HfG Offenbach1989-1995 study of fine arts , painting, at the University of Art Stí_delschule, Frankfurt, Prof. Jí_rg Immendorf1995 first master student of Jí_rg Immendorff2003 assistant professor at the Kunstakademie Hohenaschau2013 died in FrankfurtExhibitions ( selected ) :1990 first group exhibition at Stí_delschule1992 cooperation work on stage background for WDR -TV ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ studio on the ART COLOGNE1993 solo exhibition ' Cafe Cult' Frankfurt,ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ solo exhibition gallery 'Experiment Kunst', Frankfurt1994 group exhibition Mc Cann Erickson,ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ solo exhibition gallery 'Experiment Kunst', Frankfurt,1995 cooperation work on interiors of the C+L by students Stí_del1996 solo exhibition gallery 'Experiment Kunst', Frankfurt,1997 group exhibition of studio 3.

1026," We are a group of people sharing deep attachment to creating comics. Hence our interest in drawing people and our specialized background in art have led us to come up with our own style of portrait drawings. Although you can find lots of pop art styled portraits all around the web, you will see that our style is definitely one of its kind.Our portraits are stylish mixtures of simplified facial figures and yet detailed facial expressions. Often we'd like to emphasize or even exaggerate a person's eye color and hair. For a background of a portrait, we always select a theme that would further characterize the person we draw.1. Print and display. It is definitely an ice breaker! You can even print it on a canvas and display it like this.2. You can use it as your online profile picture. Check out the profile of one of us (James Yun) at Kickstarter.3. For the reasons 1 & 2, it is a great gift for your loving ones. We found that young girls love it.Until now, we have been just drawing this type of portraits for our friends as gifts, but we've always wanted to do something more with it. So as a humble beginning of this dream, we decided to make a calendar for the year 2015.But, of course, it wouldn't be just a calendar.It will be a calendar filled with pop art portraits of you and your loved ones!!!Don't have many friends?

1027," The Story so Far:For as long as I can remember, my father has always been an amazing artist. He has always been involved in some sort of creative project and his influence inspired me to study ceramics and later go on to be an art teacher. My father supported and helped me through high school and TAFE (technical college) but the sad truth is that he has always been a labourer, I have only ever known him to be employed in jobs that are physically demanding with little room for his creative talents.ŒæHe is now in his mid 60's and still working but time is catching up with him. His knees are shot from his time as a carpet layer, he has torn ligaments in his shoulder from manually moving steel, he has ruptured disks in his spine from a slow and steady life of lifting heavy objects, and still he is a labourer. Yet through it all he has always found the time to create art, sometimes at ridiculous times in the morning before he drives to work, on Friday nights after a few beers or on the weekend when he is not patching up the home that he has lived in for over 30 years.With your assistance I want to bring his amazing pencil work to the world and give him the opportunity to leave behind his life as a labourer and turn a new page in his life doing the thing that he loves the most, creating beautiful, thought-provoking art. I intend to release a series of high quality reproductions of some of his most amazing drawings on 320gsm Elite Rag Paper in a variety of sizes. The scale of some of these drawings is immense, the largest being 245 centimeters high by 110 centimeters wide and as a result most reproductions will come in full size, three quarter size, half size and quarter size. We are using the services of ""Art House Reproductions"" to execute the scanning and printing. They have been in business for over 12 years and come highly recommended. They use a 1200 megapixle camera to obtain highly detailed images and create Giclee Inkjet Print reproductions. With the right care these prints should last a lifetime. To start with I am offering reproductions of two of his works, ""Last Journey of Cicada"" and ""Scout: Astrogator of Inner Space"" but I would like to offer another three of his works as stretch goals should there be enough support (and I promise that these drawings are even more amazing!). Shipping. This has been one of the things that I have spent a large amount of time attempting to find a suitable balance. In Australia we do not have a large amount of flexibility with international post and I am not prepared to send literally hundreds of dollars of artwork overseas without some form of tracking. As a result I can post to a number of countries at a reasonable price, some others at double the postage price and everywhere else not mentioned in the chart below at triple the postage price. $4000: We will release a third (larger) work.$6000: All printed work will come with an explanation about the inspiration and meaning behind the work. $8000: We release the fourth piece (larger again). $10000: We will release the fifth (and largest completed) of Tom's drawings. This is, in my humble opinion Dad's best work yet. It will also be the hardest one to get to the printers because it has been drawn on board (and is too jolly big to fit in the car). As a result, if we make it to this goal we will need to hire a ute.$12000: If we make it to this point I will release certificates of authenticity to all people who bought drawings at three quarter size or larger."
1028," This project is simple.Œæ I am an artist.Œæ I may not be a good artist by any way of measuring artistic skill, but I am an artist.Œæ I want to share my art with the world.Œæ This project is to fund a startup business similar to what backers of this project will receive.Œæ For providing money and an idea of what they want drawn, I will provide a drawing.Œæ I will give it my best shot.Œæ As you'll see with the backer awards, backers get a special chance to receive the same benefits, but as part of this fantastic Kickstarter campaign.Œæ These backer awards make for great gifts, particularly with Christmas coming up.Œæ My kids are better artists than I am, so at times I may include them in the coloring or even drawing aspects of that piece of art.ŒæŒæ The funds will ultimately go towards establishing the business and website that will promote my art to the world. This venture is designed to bring happy where there is sad."
1029," I am a self-taughtartist/illustrator livingŒæand working inŒæOklahoma City,Oklahoma.ŒæŒæI am wanting to turn my hobby into a business, but I lackthe equipment to do so.Œæ IŒæam planning on purchasing a laser printerand necessary supplies to create my own line of note cards and greeting cardsat home.Œæ If I have the necessary equipment at home, I can work from mygarage and control the quality of what I'm producing rather than rely on aprint shop.I can work my own hourstoo.That's a huge plus.For my projectlaunch, I am wanting to produce Sugar Skull Note Cards.Sugar skulls are part of the Mexican holiday""Day of the Dead"", which is actually a 2 day festival right afterHalloween commemorating loved ones gone before us.Sugar skulls are traditionally verydecorative and colorful, and were originally made from sugar.I love drawing them, and there are so manypatterns and colors that can be incorporated into the design.They are very vibrant, and I think they wouldlook great on note cards.With a laserprinter, I would be able to print them on heavy cardstock with colorfast inksthat would be fade and moisture resistant making a great quality product.The initial packagewould be 16 note cards with colored envelopes, most likely packaged incellophane sleeves.Boxes are apossibility, I haven't decided for sure on that part yet.There will be four designs, four cards ofeach design."
1030," Best Friends Forever. Portraits of best friends.Do you have a best friend? If so, you are a fortunate person. Celebrate that amazing relationship.ŒæWant to give them an amazing gift that will have their jaw drop on the floor? This is it.This is a unique, one of kind project. The artist, Dan Burke, is an accomplished illustrator with an amazing skill at drawing people. He has drawn comic books, children's books, magazine and book covers and more, for over 40 years. ŒæHe is now producing a fully illustrated book on the theme of ""best friends"", and you can be in the book!The book will contain over 50 illustrations of ""best friends"". The fund raised for this project will be used for book production costs and shipping.You can have Dan draw you, or someone you know, or choose, and have that illustration appear in the book and receive a 5 foot (by 3 foot) copy of your original one of kind poster. ŒæIf you want, a custom, 5 foot wide portrait of two people, of your choice, will be created for you. It's a bargain for this amazing experience.He has drawn portraits daily for over 44 years. The style is bold, accurate and very pop art. The portraits that appear in this book are all custom made, especially for this book, at this time. Most of the portraits will be drawn in October, November of 2014. The book will feature illustrations of best friends from history, fiction and real life, both living and dead.The ""Best Friends Forever""Œæbook will be proofed and published within the USA ŒæduringŒæthe last week of November 2014, and mailed out first class the first week of December 2014. The book will have a color cover, black and white interior, and be soft bound. The book will arrive around December 12 to the 16, 2014. Out of USA arrival will take several weeks longer.Some of you might choose to have your own ""best friend"" portrait included in this book. You have the option. Some of you may choose to back the project just for the book. Either way I thank you in advance. Let me tell you about the art. The portrait makes an amazing gift no one will ever forget. You can choose to have Dan (that's me) draw two people anyway you want! A fantastic wedding or anniversary gift. They won't believe it when they see it! When I unroll one of these for a client, they are always very excited. Friends and others can't stop commenting on it. Seeing a large print of yourself, drawn like this, is a thrilling one of a kind experience. I know from 40 years of experience how great the reaction is for something like this.All Custom ""Best Friends"" Portraits will be delivered via email December 1, 2014. These portraits are in PDF high resolution format and will be sent to your email in two sizes. Some emails do not accept large files, make sure yours does! The first PDF of your art will be is 5 feet by 3 (244 megabytes). The second PDF of your art will be 11 by 17 inches (44 megabytes). This is for smaller prints. There is no shipping of portraits as we do not print posters and ship them. You can have the portrait printed locally cost effectively. A 5 foot poster prints (on canvas) for about $40 to $60 depending on where you live. If you use a 20% coupon at the local Office type store you can print the artwork very cheaply.ŒæThe portrait can be of any two people you want illustrated. Someone you know getting married? Want to give them an amazing gift? This is something they will never forget. Better than a toaster.ŒæDrawing accurate likeness is a skill. One of the fun things about this project is the drawings, though stylized, offer a very accurate likeness of the subject. Can you tell who the people are?Thank you for reading and considering this project.ŒæDan has bold ""pop art"" style. If you like this graphic style of art, you will love your portrait. Please have a wonderful day and thank you again.ŒæA recreation of the ""Last Supper"" for monster fans."
1031," Being a printmaker, I always had interest in applying printmaking techniques to other disciplines. Creating sticker designe is something I always wanted to try, and since I had some ideas from a wood cut i created, I decided to turn it into a sticker.The deer skull design is originally printed by hand, multiple color reduction relief print. Edition of 10. Then I've scanned in the main layer (the black outlines) and the 2nd layer which had some interesting carved marks, and put these together on photoshop. I'm hoping that people will like the design as well as I do."
1032," Over the next twelve months I have the chance to apprentice with a talented tattoo artist in Kutztown PA, who has a great reputation.Art is an important part of my life. I'm excited that I could be able to use my artistic ability to make a living as a tattoo artist.Unfortunately my parents don't have the money I need to do this. So, it's a little weird, but I'm asking for help here. There are rewards for helping me (be sure to check those out).Because this apprenticeship starts this fall and the money is needed up front, I don't have time to get a job and save the money...so I'm trying this.At the end of the apprenticeship I am guaranteed a job and the tools I need to be a tattoo artist.My first six months will be training. At the end of those six months and if I'm approved I will begin actually putting ink to skin.I appreciate that you've taken the time to stop and look!"

1035, We are raising this money to bring two artists one pen to life. It is my sister in law Jessica Darling and myself Devin Scott weve been artist for years but we'd like to go farther than freelance artist so were creating this art/sketchbook to get our foot in the door! Artist everywhere know how troubling it is to get out there in the art community. Were hoping that getting this project funded will not only inspire us to work harder but inspire artists everywhere to chase their dreams!
1036," As I drifted back to Kickstarter each week or so to look at the projects, coupled with the osmosis of press and social network activity surrounding the site, it got me wondering, who are you all?ŒæPeople from all sorts of walks of live, differing countries, economies and levels of wealth contribute daily andŒægenerateŒæhuge sums of money to help ideas bloom.I wondered how I might document this community and decided that the little illustrations I do might be a fun way to show the faces of the crowd sourced economy. By recording this way, an abstract view of us all can be exhibited without breaking the anonymity our pledges provide us to the wider public.As part of the process, I will scan each portrait and print it off in postcard format and then exhibit them here in London and online. If it goes well, maybe we'll have the funds to take this to another city, but we'll cross that bridge if it looms on the horizon."

1038," Hi! My name is Jessica Bastidas. I grew up in Bethlehem, PA but currently go to school in Baltimore, MD where I am pursuing a career in Fine Arts, Illustration, and Teaching. I have just reached my 21rst year and think it is about time to make my dream of owning and operating my own printing press a reality.ŒæI have experimented in copper and zinc etching and engraving as well as drypoint techniques, monoprinting, woodcuts, and linocuts. A printing press is essential to continuing to produce and expand my lexicon of imagery after my graduation from school. With your pledges, you will receive completely original artworks signed by myself with subjects that include landscapes, cityscapes, abstractions, and portraits as well as preserving an often under appreciated art form. Please see the video for examples of these works.I take inspiration from the unique people I meet and the stories they share. Music and literature is another inspiration for my works which often blend aspects of fantasy and magic with harsh realism and factual narratives.Despite my youth, I have worked as a freelance artist for over eight years and am experienced at producing, packaging, and shipping artwork within the U.S. and across the globe.ŒæThe printmaking process has helped to improve all facets of my art even changing the manner in which I approach painting, illustration, and drawing."

ŒæIn order to be able to continue developing them as pieces in the digital format as well as getting them printed in bulk, so that I may sell them and share them with more people. ŒæI would also like to purchase a few pieces of equipment. ŒæAn extendable light with a lighted magnifine glass, in order to create more detail without continuosly squinting. ŒæAnd a large easel so that I may begin to work with larger formats, ie; 4x10 feet."
1041," As a full time Illustrator, it is tough to start and complete personal projects.ŒæThese projects come straight from the heart and soul and are a true reflection of who you or your aspirations/interests.ŒæOver the years, it has been challenging Œæto complete my personal projects, to see them come to life. Juggling clients' projects and everyday life, itŒægets quite difficult to dedicate time, energy and love to personal projects.Finally!ŒæCURIOUS MIX is ready for the next step - This is a series of fun, quirkyŒæand silly experiment-inspired illustrations designed to fascinate you.ŒæThis is one project I would love to see in print and could really use your support and encouragement.

1043," My name is Maria Bozina. I am an artist and Illustrator. Iwould like to present my art project äóìWelly Through My Eyesäó.I have created acollection of 12 illustrations about Wellington, New Zealand. Each illustrationis dedicated to each month of the year.Originally, Iäó»mfrom Russia, but New Zealand has become my home. This is such an inspirationalcountry, and here are no similarities with Russia. So I thought it would benice to draw the city and country with my own vision through a surreal prism.I would like to publishthe illustrations in form of a calendar, stamps and postcards. I am looking forany support from publishers to publish, promote, distribute and sale theproducts. Also, Iäó»m going to exhibit the original illustrations.I am launchingthis Kickstarter Œæin order to publish my work.With your help Iwill cover such expenses as:Œ‡framing of illustrationsŒ‡art gallery renting and commission feesŒ‡publishingŒ_ of postcards and calendarsŒ‡assistance and collaborationI am very thankful for your help.Samples of the illustrations:Project was inspired by my ownŒæNew ZealandŒælife experience. The Project is just a reflection of my own vision without repeating common patterns and popular impressions.The goal of the project is to show New Zealand seasons of the year and daily life in surreal style through public display and exhibition."
1044," I am right out of school for illustration and graphic design, and I am currently trying to get my career off the ground. I have a work station that I have been using through school and had plans to keep using it to get started on the right track, but it has blown out its graphics card and I cannot use it any longer. In addition, I am looking to purchase a graphic design tablet screen that all current professionals in my field use.With my low income, I cannot afford to purchase these items out right, with no financing options for this equipment. This field is not kind to those that are starting out with little to no money. My plans are to finish two childrenäó»s books with more to come in the future, along with a graphic novel and business designs including: logos, web design, and graphics.Œæ"

1047," Almost as long as I have been alive, I have read science fiction and fantasy. My father died tragically when I was only 6 years old, but left an extensive library of sci-fi books among his belongings.These I began reading in grammar school. I have never stopped.ŒæDuring those same formative years, I was slowly developing the chops to become a professional artist, with sf and fantasy frequently the subject matter. I realized my dream to some extent, becoming a freelance illustrator in the pre-digital age. But the fantasy art genre was a difficult field to break into. I had to take work that wasn't exactly my ideal.Enter the computer age, and now fantasy art is even more competitive. I have about as much chance of making my living this way as I have of becoming an ""A-List"" film star. Even if you're good, you can be overlooked.ŒæI've made a living in related fields, graphic design, web design, etc. And now that I am too old for most companies to hire me full time, I eek out a living as a self-employed designer/illustrator.ŒæI figured, when no one else wants to hire me, why not hire myself? The digital age has spawned some amazing digital artists. But the Internet can cut both ways. Because KickStarter exists, I hope to assign myself work, and make a living at it.ŒæThe plan is to do the work I love, and offer work that shows my skill in its best light, because this WILL be my ideal. My fantasy art calendar will be for science fiction and fantasy fans like myself. I will sell the 2016 calendar on Amazon beginning in 2015, for $19.99. In July, drop the price to $15.99, and September, to $9.99.ŒæFantasy Calendars do exist, but most either feature one of the few artists who have achieved star status, or they rely solely on barely-clad female figures (or both). I am not opposed to the beauty of women in art, I often include the feminine form myself, but can quality fantasy art exist without resorting to borderline pornography? I believe so. Great art is more than titillation.ŒæThe goal amount will cover printing, shipping & handling, distribution & order fulfillment, shipping of rewards, and incidentals. The purchase price will allow me to continue doing the work I choose."
1048," I plan on traveling to Morocco and visiting as many cities as possible in a couple weeks to experience as much of the culture as I can. Students these days are always choosing the typical places, when equally cultural places like Morocco are passed over. I want to share its beauty with the younger generation and show them how great of an experience you can have there.The final portfolio/ scrapbook will be created for localŒæcolleges study abroad offices to promote students to travel to this country, which is oftenŒæpassed over for the more popular travels.

1049," Our kids have been cranking out greeting card after greeting card lately, each ruder than the last. Family and friends have all been exposed to these cards, and we would like to spread the infection to the rest of you. We are also pruning our kids' entrepreneurial spirit: if they want something, they need to find their own way to make it happen.How we will use the funds:1. Supplies. We want to supply the kids with something other than computer paper and newsprint. Kids would love to use actual cardstock.2. ŒæRewards. Part of the funds will be used to reward our Kickstarter funders through customized greeting cards for our largest supporters.3. ŒæBabysitting. ŒæI will use $20 of the funds (and no more) to hire a babysitter and get away from my three kids for two hours. I refuse to take Œæmy terrors to Target one more time; they are seriously ruining the place for me.ŒæThe rest of the funds will be used to promote our home based business; we hope the kids will be able to sell their cards at Spencer's one day."

1051," Cute animals with wise words - what better subject for a calendar?Pawprint Illustration was born from my love of animals and my desire to dive back into traditional watercolour painting.

His other artworks are online on ourŒæFacebookŒæpage.Hi my name is Julie Hazell we would really like to get T Shirts and Soft Toys made so we can share Dead Ted with his fans.ŒæSam inflicts various injuries on Dead Ted, but Ted always lives to fight another day. Dead Ted has the saddest eyes that make you just want to hug him and the sweetest personality.ŒæA little over a year ago I talked with Sam about Dead Ted and where we could take him. I saw distinct possibilities for marketing this little teddy. Endless opportunities are out there for us to chase and running my successful bookkeeping business for over 5 years I could see the enormous potential.ŒæI had a couple of T Shirts printed with Dead Ted on and they looked great, then I decided to see what Dead Ted would look like on other things I had a cup, cap and key ring made. I showed these to all our friends and family and had really positive feedback, so I decided to go online with Ted and see what other people thought of him.ŒæOur Dead Ted Facebook page facebook/deadted1 has over 2000 likes since we started promoting it in late June 2014.

1056," Hi there. My name is Jasmyne Butz. I live in Fairbanks, Alaska. I work full time for a janitorial company. I Œæalso write and illustrate my own children's books. I didn't have what you'd call a Normal upbringing. I dealt with a lot of things growing up that no child should have to face. But I wouldn't change my past for the world. It is in this terrible past that I found my passion. I feel that out of tragedy comes great beauty. During my childhood when times were hard I would make books. Books with hidden positive messages in them for myself. I would read these books when times were hard and they always made me feel better. It was when I got older that I realized how many children could benefit from these books with such valuable lessons. I started to make more and more. Each one geared towards a different situation with a lesson to be learned or a problem to overcome. I feel like I can be the voice for our youth today. With these books I can teach them valuable life lessons that let them know that they are not alone. I will and can reach this goal through Dorrance Publishing company when I can come up with the 6,700.00 its going to take to produce and market my book. But by backing me you have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor and get your pick of a vast array of benefits. I will reach my goal one way or another.But this way you get something out of it as well."

1063," MelJane Watercolors was born out of my love for watercolors and my desire to pursue a career that allows me to push my creativity to its fullest. I was driven to find something I enjoyed that allowed me to share my creativity with others while providing them with practical products. After careful consideration I settled on transferring my watercolor paintings into everyday products. It seems that nowadays we use our phones and ipads for everything and it doesn't look like that will change anytime soon. I find that I use my phone for almost everything. However, I still believe in the old standbys. Remember notebooks, sticky notes, desk calendars? All of these and more are products that I want to bring to you! And in the spirit of moving forward I will also be making products such as phone and Ipad cases. I feel very confident in my ability to create a brand which appeals to the masses. Any support you are willing to extend would be greatly appreciated. Based on my years of experience in sales and customer service I hope to run a company that people feel they can trust."

1065," I am going to enlarge pictures from a series of paintings inspired by historical Manga and Renaissance figures. I will need large wood panels and oil paint to complete this project. There is a big space to be filled and enlarging some of the pictures to eight by eight feet, eight by four feet, would work. There are also some works on paper that need to be framed.I am painting a series of bright, zappy images. This group of figures uses pure color, pattern and anatomy to unite tradition with the contemporary. I try to give them titles that poke at a universal truth here and there. If I meet the goal I will enlarge the painting ""Everything Changes"" and others to eight by eight feet. The work will be shown later this year in Portland, Maine. I am painting invented heroes or Contemporary Bodhisattvas, in the traditional mediums of oil paint and gouache and also in Photoshop. I like giving titles that point out a truism reworked from historical quotes, zen stories and my own take on things.Œæ These pictures are inspired by the figures in Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling called ignudi, super heroes and historical Manga.Michelangeloäó»s Ignudi, the twenty elegant seated nudes painted in the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes are some of the most beautiful images in the history of Western Art and their fabulous-ness ( art history term) has remained unmatched in history, Their simplicity and grace is something I reach for to rework in a way that reflects the twenty-first century.The figures I paint sometimes look a bit like super heroes but I am also thinking aboutŒæ Bodhisattva, those wonderful, beautifully adorned figures in temples and museums that are described as beings that have delayed their own nirvana to save others. In history they are often seen as deities and today we might think of them as guardian angels. In paintings and in sculpture they are the most amazing creations and I find them a rich starting point. I love the puzzle of the human body - anatomy. Michelangelo used anatomy as a design tool. Anatomy didn'tŒæ justŒæ tell him where the parts of the body belonged, he used it to determine where a line or form would look the most beautiful. Artists today, mostly illustrators and animators,Œæ still deal with the body as a design form. Are they our Michelangelos?Artwork is enormously expensive to ship so although the paintings are not part of the rewards, I thought people might be interested in how the paintings are made. I am using oil paint with a very fat medium so that it dries very shiny. Linseed oil, pure gum spirits of turpentine and Damar varnish (one part each) makes the paint quite fat or oil rich because of the lack of turpentine and consequently it takes longer to dry but when does it remains as shiny as a wet lollypop.I also paint some in an opaque watercolor paint called gouache. Gouache has more pigment than watercolor and a very rich deep velvety quality. Last but not least I am using a drawing tablet and Photoshop to draw and paint some of the images. Some of the images below were created specifically as rewards for pledges.I am a painter, instructor and lover of art history and illustration. I drew constantly when I was young and spent hours inventing drawing games with my siblings. I study art history and anatomy and I teach drawing and painting. This is the series as it begins and reaching the goal will help add to these images. Some of these are offered as Prints in the rewards section. The black borders do not appear on the prints offered in the rewards section. Two of the pictures I will enlarge are Everything Changes "", eight by eight, feet and the horizontal version of ""If you wish really hard...,"" to eight by four feet. The works on paper will be framed.If I get enough sponsors Nickelson Editions based in beautiful Camden, Maine will begin printing the selected images. Printer, photographer and entrepreneur Jim Nickelson collaborates with artists all over the world, works with them individually and performs all processing and printing to create true fine quality digital prints.All prints are 8 1/2 x 11 inch digital prints except the laughing head group ""Everything Changes"" which are 8 1/2 x 81/2 inches. All are printed on heavy archival paper.

1066," This story is intended to be of entertainment to children and bring forth valuable and important life lessons. I hope that the book shall also teach children something about insects, which most children seem to grow a fascination with at some point, and shed new light on the value of life and connection with oneself.I'm hoping to raise some money for supplies to get the project underway, and hopefully a small aid in publishing costs when the book is complete."
1067," I moved to Asheville, NC in 2012 on my birthday in the middle of a hurricane to pursue a Master's in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture.ŒæDespite having plenty to do for school, I have found myself time and time again returning to my illustration projects. The drawing helps me keep focused but also offers needed respite from the intensity of my studies. The next couple of years will entail a substantial amount of clinical work and I will no longer be able to work a part-time job to provide many of the basic necessities that entail being a Master's student.Recently, an opportunity came up to potentially be a part of a community of local artists in downtown Asheville. The company is called ZaPow (http://www.zapow.com/) and it is run by a really rad woman named Lauren J. Patton. The space gets a lot of foot traffic, and provides tons of really unique opportunities for their artists and the greater Asheville community. It occurred to me that I could potentially use my love for illustrating to support me while I am in grad school, while all the while finding a specific outlet for decompressing, as well as a way to remain connected to the incredible community that is down here.This Kickstarter will therefore serve to lessen the start-up costs as a new artist in the space. The funds will go to buying and/or building frames, making prints and cards, and for the bulk, paying rent for the space for the required commitment of six months in the gallery. After a while, the hope is to be able to sell enough pieces and prints monthly to be able to at least pay for the space, and hopefully provide a humble, yet so gratefully welcome income while I devote most of my focus to studying Chinese Medicine.All in all, by supporting this project you would be supporting local artists and economy, supporting the creation and dissemination of art made with love, supporting the potential alleviation of some daunting student debt, and last but not least, supporting the future generation of medicine and healing.ŒæThank you for reading and even more for the support!P.s. Here are some examples of an Astrological Sign series I'm presently working on!"
1068," I have a really simple goal, spread love and caring. My project started from that simple goal and a passion for creating. I want to combine those two things and give art and love to those who may need it in the moment or those who no longer receive that blessing from those around them.My art style is fairly unique, a metamorphosis of tribal art and doodling in the margins of textbooks on philosophy and religion during college. Over time it came to simply represent whatever I was feeling at the time, being often up to interpretation of the viewer. With these pictures I will enclose a letter of support and encouragement, a message of love and hope for someone who may need it. Hopefully I can make a difference in at least one person's life just by letting them know they're not alone and somebody really does care."
1069," I am a mother of three young children, formerly employed in the corporate world. I took a leap of faith when my second child was born to stay at home and raise my children while my husband has continued doing the daily grind.In the process, I discovered I have a large entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for graphic design as well as a great talent for painting and drawing. More importantly, I found a way to combine my desire to be at home for my children with my passion for art and graphic design. During the past three years, I have built my own ecommerce store selling specialty toys while working freelance jobs as a graphic designer,Œæ designing logos, brochures, posters, websites etc. In my spare time, whenever I have it, I love sketching and painting people and pets. As a pet lover myself, I understand the love, care and compassion it takes to care for one and the allure of having your personal pet within the pages of a book dedicated to them and their owners.Staying true to the notion of following my heart, I decided to try this platform out after hearing about it on the news. Essentially, when exploring this site, it led me to the idea of creating a unique book pet portrait book of my work that I would like to call ""Paws United."" It will be a compilation of various watercolor pet portraits that I will designing based on your pets. I would like to ultimately sell it locally and perhaps even online to pet lovers and offer it as a gift to my children.Please bear in mind that I am completely new to this idea and this is my first project on kickstarter so I will work respectfully with you if you promise to do the same in return. I hope you engage in my project and help me make the book a success!"

1071," I am Benjamin Mason i have just graduated from an illustration course in the UK with a large debt and and an education that doesn't quite match (not saying i am not a skilled illustrator just my course and tutors left a lot to be desired) and now i am back home with my parents. now i know this isn't anything new or amazing pretty much every student has to move back home and pretty much every student comes out of uni feeling they have been part of an elaborate scam. anyway il get to the point i want to set up a studio to produce illustrations, comics and just overall to get my work out there....simple as that....well saying it is simple, doing it on the other hand might prove tricky. thats where you peeps could step in (if you fancy it) any pledges from one shilling to two drachma would be super helpful, i suppose the best way to decide if you want to pledge would be to have a mosey through my website, check it out and see if anything takes your fancy. you are probably wondering what the plan of attack is so here it is, basically i am aiming to convert a large storage shed in my parents yard into a fully functioning illustration studio for screen printing and other creative endeavours, this is going to be quite a task since it has been used to hold all kinds of junk since the 80's, once i have it cleared out and fixed up the next step would be making it liveable in by insulating it and putting down lino flooring and then finally fitting it out with all the hardware for screen printing and image making, my aim is to have it converted from run down old shed to active illustration studio before the year is out. the reason whyŒæi decided i wanted to set up my own studio was to have a place where i can work away from my parents house since they both work from home and there is constantly people coming and going which makes it quite busy and noisy and not the place you want to be doing any creative work in.my website http://benbryanmason.wix.com/benmasonillustrationthanksBenjaminŒæ"

Taking extra classes & Studies to improve my skills and connections. The funds will also be used to buy the tools to make this all possible, for example; crochet hooks, paint and pencils, canvas etc. everything goes solely to this project. Most of the cost will be the classes I want to take to improve advanced skills in drawing and illustrating.ŒæMy biggest wish is to be a successful illustrator/designer!

Using my skills as an illustrator and my connections within the company along with outside printers, i feel like given the time and money I could put together my dream project.The concept of Kara's Kostumes came from starting a family and watching my daughter play dress up. Having the story really come to life as she tries different costumes on and playing out the story. Each story would feature a different costume and each story would have a different learning aspect in the end. The different costumes would have many different jobs and duties, not just gender stereotyped costumes. My hope is that young girls get inspired to be anything that she wants to be when she grows up.I have included a small project I did in college to show my illustration skills."

Muffin Friends are here to stay.Each Muffin Friend is planned out by me and then drawn and colored on a nice piece of paper, just like the kind used by your printer.Names are also chosen by me to reflect each pastry's unique joys and views in life. My unique naming process ensures a one of a kind pastry which is an essential piece of the Muffin Madness! world of wonder and surprise.I suppose if everyone is really nice to me and stuff I might let you pick your own Muffin Friend as long as it's not something disturbing.Only in the land of Muffonia can you mail things with a large cartoon stamp.You so funny, grasshopper!

1082," Allow me, if you will, a few moments of your time to introduce myself and to briefly tell you about my unique pen and ink drawings and an exciting new children's book I am writing and illustrating.  My name is C.M. Spraggin and my background mainly consists of working in advertising or a related field as an illustrator / designer.  While working in advertising I also did a few murals here and there and even managed to do a little teaching part time.  I have recently retired to doing my own art work and plan to market my limited edition giclee prints online through my website that is now up and running.  Each and every pen and ink drawing is done solely by hand and comes from my imagination.  One drawing takes hundreds of thousands of lines and dots to create and at least three to four months to complete.  Time consuming and tedious, yes, but the finished piece is well worth the effort.As for the children's book I am unable to divulge very much regarding the story itself other than it's about a young boy with an overly active imagination that stumbles across an old abandoned tree house in the forest near his home and the life altering adventures he discovers within.The book is based upon actual events that took place  during an extremely difficult time for a young boy who finds a way to cope with the harsh realities of his life simply by using his imagination.    The name of the book is ,""A Castle in the Trees"" and the young boy was me.My reason for putting this together is to try and raise funds to purchase a giclee printer and all the accessories that are needed to do the prints myself. Once the children's book is completed I will need to employ a ghost writer and take the book to print.ŒæThis is a project I have dreamed of doing for years but couldn't afford it.

Project completion, including editing time, is expected December 2014. If a traditional publisher is used the actual date of publication would be later, of course.My ghost doesn't have a name and at the center of this journal is her search for that missing part of her identity, as well as answers to the circumstances surrounding her death.I can't predict what the ghost might say or do, but some days she will observe quiet things.

I cut decals and put the name on the window. It didnäó»t make my car faster, it was more of a visual distraction so that you didnäó»t notice the dent in the door. That was a long time ago. In between drawings I played about 2500 baseball games. This is a mix of sports, cars and art.Late last year I designed car wraps for food trucks, race cars, and plumber trucks. I did a little evaluation. I broke the car down to degrees of decoratability. Actually, donäó»t think that is a word but you get where Iäó»m coming from. A full wrap is the highest degree. It is a major commitment. On the other end, the first thing people will decorate is the back window. The reason I found is that you know you can take it off with a razor blade. Here is the breakdown.A) Full Wrap B) Partial Wrap C) Doors D) Bumper E) WindowsI did some A and C with plans on D but I decided to skip to E. If you are still reading I commend you, this is actually a pretty goofy story.I started to do automotive window research. In general, the stick-figure family is pretty popular.

I wondered if he is actually still in the trunk or possibly his ashes are in the glove compartment. This is the problem of the active mind.

1095," ""NOT FUNNY HA-HA"" is a very special illustrated book. ŒæIt is a bold, slightly wry, graphic novel illustrating the lives of two young women who go through two different abortions.Following the lives of the girls (both coming from different cultural, family, and financial backgrounds), the novel begins at the moment that they decide to have abortions, then follows them through the process of choosing a clinic, reaching out to friends, partners, and/or family....and eventually the procedure(s) itself.ŒæWe watch as one of the girls decides to have a medical abortion, while the other decides on a surgical procedure. ŒæNOT FUNNY HA-HA does not address the events leading up to the pregnancy, or even the decision-making before choosing abortion as an option. ŒæIt simply shows (with an understanding wink) what happens when a woman GOES THROUGH IT, no questions asked. ŒæIt takes the viewer through the process from the waiting room to the bathroom to the weeks after, when the girls have gone ""back to real life"". ŒæIt shows how each other them relates what happened to their world again, how they see their bodies change, and what that means to them.ŒæThe book is meant to be a non-judgmental, comforting, even humorous look at what a woman can go through after she decides to have an abortion.NOT FUNNY HA-HA is a little bit technical, a little bit moving, and often funny.  Although the subject matter is heavy, the illustration are light (drawn in simple pencil on paper), and the text is hand-drawn.  The author takes a step back from putting forth any personal opinion whatsoever:  simply laying out the events and possibly emotional repercussions that could, and often do occur.  This is a book that a friend might buy for her girlfriend to read either before, during, or after going through an abortion.  This is a frank, but touching look at something many, many women go through, in a format that has not been done before.for more images from the book, please visit the NOT FUNNU HA-HA Twitter account:https://twitter.com/NOTFUNNYBOOKŒæ"
1096," I am trying to raise money to travel to Brazil. My major is Ethnic, Gender, and Labor Studies, and going to Brazil to focus on this art project would really help go towards my major.I want to focus on the graffiti art that is mainly located in the slums of Brazil, and the messages they share specifically on the FIFA World Cup, 2014. Brazilians live and breathe football, but hosting this event in their country? ŒæThis raises a lot of emotion, such as anger and concern for many Brazilians in regards to the World Cup. ŒæThe people who live in the favelas orŒæ""slums,"" are overlooked and ignored by society and their government. The Brazilian government is spending millions, even billions, of dollars towards the World Cup, 2014 as well as the summer Olympics that will be hosted in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.  The last time Brazil hosted the World Cup was back in 1950, but now in 2014, they host it again, and more people have been speaking out towards it.  It is sad because the government is spending so much money on the World Cup, but they cannot use any of that money to help their own citizens do so much as eat and be clothed. The only way they can share their opinions and have their voices be heard is through the art of graffiti. Graffiti in Brazil is different to graffiti in the United States. Graffiti in Brazil is bigger, bolder, and has a deeper message behind it. You can see the message of the art as well as understand the artist. Brazilians are even standing directly outside of the capitol Brasí_lia and protesting with signs written in English so that they can capture the attention of the whole world.My goal is to raise money so that I can travel to Brazil and participate in these protests and graffiti artwork. As much as I love soccer and watching the World Cup, the Brazilian government is in the wrong for letting their own citizens suffer. I will be traveling to Brazil to work with a popular graffiti street artist named Dinas, and other graffiti artists to help spread the word of the poverty and despair that the Brazilian citizens are facing.  It is important to understand and realize a different point of view on the reactions and feelings of Brazilians towards the World Cup.Brazilian graffiti is important to me because it is so detailed and just beautiful. It is an ignored art with a message that must be heard!The video shows graffiti artist Dinas who I interviewed last year when I went to Brazil. This year I want to go to Brazil because Dinas will be doing a mural in the streets of Rio de Janeiro which is an area with a lot of tourists, so it will be seen during the World Cup and surely be seen after.  Dinas showed me the basics of graffiti art while I went last year, but he will be teaching me a lot more when I visit him again. I will also be meeting up with graffiti artist Paulo Ito to participate in another mural of his. ŒæHere is a mural he just recently completed in response to the World Cup called, ""Need Food, Not Football"":""The Brazilian taxpayersäó» fear of being stuck with the World Cupäó»s $11 billion price tag has been realized most noticeably with an increase in the cost of living since winning the hosting bid in 2007.""I want to be a participant in this future mural because I want to be the voice from an international perspective and slowly be a part of helping out Brazil. ŒæWorking on the mural during and even after the World Cup will allow the world to see the reactions of many Brazilians towards this event.So join me with this mural that is will be the voice of the people. Although I am only one person trying to get this idea out there and share the voices of people who are not heard, I know I can do it especially with the help of this awesome Kickstarter community!  This mural is for people who live in the slums of Brazil and who are ignored. I know this graffiti art project will be a great success.Here is an example of a video of some popular graffiti street art pieces that forever remain on the walls, buildings, trains, cars, and planes, of Brazil:With your help and contributions, I would be able to use it on travel expenses (plane ticket, hotel, food) and materials such as spray paint and other necessary tools to help with this graffiti mural and graffiti art and help spread the word. ŒæI want to give tools mainly for these artists because they are doing more than just graffiti, they are creating a lasting piece of art with an important and powerful message for all to see, and I am all about supporting a good cause.äóìThe world cup takes our schools and hospitals and leaves us its äóÖballsäó».äó"

1099," When The Heart Betrays The Blood is a 120 page art book and I'm launching this page to raise money to print a first edition.When The Heart Betrays The Blood is the story of a young Jewish girläó»s escape from sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle via her strange relationship with the son of a white supremacist. Within this lurid Gothic romance the book asks complex ethical questions about personal conduct and group identity. It contrasts evil actions with evil ideology and asks you the reader to evaluate if an otherwise harmless man carrying a banner for an evil cause is worse than a man who portrays himself as decent and upright while quietly being monstrous in his private life. I think issues like this get muddled in a lot of contemporary discourse, wherein we assume so much about individuals, judging them by superficial things like what religion they profess or what party they support. Things that don't indicate much when it comes to how much integrity an individual has.When The Heart Betrays The Blood is a story told in drawings and writing; a sort of image and text dialectic. The images aren't there to bolster the text and the text isn't there to elucidate the images; they're both telling the story directly, but with different voices. My thesis with this project was always that image and text exist in a continuum of graphic communication and they could be engaged in a sort of ""duet"" format whereby they are separate and equal. This not only appeals to me for aesthetic reasons, but also for the varied interpretations it welcomes the reader to imagine. By segregating the images and the text on separate pages I left open space; space to picture images when reading the text, and space to imagine dialogue while looking at the images.The images are scratchboard. Conceptually, I wanted them to look like wood engravings, but sort of glitched; like you're looking at a wire frame rendering on a magnet-damaged monitor. They have a distinct sort of ""vibrating"" optical illusion quality that I'm really proud of. I formatted the text like a screenplay because that's how comic books are initially written. In its early stages I thought of this project as a sort of abstraction of what a comic book is. The longer I worked on it the more it developed an identity beyond that sort of conceptual gimmick. The culmination of over four years of labor, When The Heart Betrays The Blood stands as a massive milestone in my personal artistic development and I think, given a chance to be seen, it will find an appreciative audience. I hope you will be a member of that first audience!If you're on the fence and would like to read a sample send me a message and I'll respond with a short PDF.Thanks for checking the project out! "
1100," A sample of our illustrations:Have a favorite story you think should be in the collection? Let us know here: http://bookses.com/rBookses is a project to illustrate stories. It's a place and a process where artists at all levels can contribute small improvements at a time to an illustration, making it just a little bit better, until the whole story is illustrated by a team of potentially thousands of artists. To give an analogy, it's like Wikipedia, but instead of writing factual articles on a topic, we create original illustrations for a story.It's the illustrator's version of jamming. The idea is not to do everything by yourself, but to have a conversation with one another, to leave room for the next person to be creative. That's why it's so important that everyone contributes just a little bit at a time to a drawing, to make it just a little bit better, or different. Then someone else can add their own take, and so on. I believe it's this element of back-and-forth that makes an experience fun and engaging. If everyone did a complete illustration on their own, it wouldn't be a game. It'd just be an art exhibition.Each artist is not only encouraged but urged to add their own ideas and personality to the work. Ideas that wouldn't occur to one person working alone would eventually occur to someone else, and they'll make it happen. Think you can render more convincing water? Just get a copy and go for it. Don't like how cartoony a guy's face turned out? Grab the previous version and branch your own. Is there a better way to draw this whole scene? Why not do it all over from scratch? Like someone's idea from another illustration? Why not adapt and extend it? The best reason I can give for myself is that there are some stories I really love---Harry Potter, Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Wizard of Earthsea, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones---that I'd love to illustrate for fun. You'd want to contribute because the book means something to you, and you want to connect with other people who feel the same way.On the other hand, if you're really good, we'll pay you to do what you love! See our hiring notice below.Since this is our pilot book, it's likely there won't be enough casual contributors to complete the book. However, we've assembled a core and guest team of talented young illustrators to make sure you get a quality book  on time regardless of fan contribution. Our ongoing hiring process and flexible collaboration schedule also means we'll have a constant flow and mix of new talent, making the art that much more interesting.In the Project timeline below I'll work out how long it would take 7 artists working full time to complete this particular book.If you can color inside the lines, you can help. If you go outside the lines once in a while, you can still help. Someone else will improve your work. If you keep coloring outside the lines, you're probably an artist!In fact, an unexpected upshot is that beginning art students can learn how to draw, by watching more experienced artists at work and by participating in the process. There's no better way to learn than doing.In an effort to keep production costs manageable, in this first iteration of the project we've decided to illustrate a collection of 20 short stories, over a period of 2 months. You still get to vote on the titles, in any genre, provided that they are public domain and approximately 5 pages. Grimms' and Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales are great examples, or we could go with an international selection from Project Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Short_Stories_%28Bookshelf%29Want more artists and stories? We've got you covered! Please check out our stretch goals below.You have a choice of a soft or a hard cover edition, or both. (You can also send one of the artists a similar set to show your appreciation. See the rewards section to the right.) The book will be somewhere around 100 pages,  printed  8 x 10 in portrait full color pages on 100 lb glossy paper. BONUS! Since this pilot project is mostly a proof of concept to demonstrate the new collaborative process and not strictly a traditional illustrated book, in cases of spectacular collaboration there'll be a work in progress reel showing the evolution of a work.We'll be illustrating 20 short stories spread out over 2 months. That works out to about 2 and a half stories every week, or one story every 2 days.Assuming each story has 5 pages, and on average one illustration per page, we'll be doing 5 drawings over two days. On each of the two days, 7 or more artists will collaborate in a 3-hour sprint, broken down into 15-minute sessions of incremental improvement.Of course, casual contributors won't be subject to the same schedule! They can chip in whenever they feel like it.And that's a good thing! Your money will not only fund the book production, it'll also help us keep on improving Bookses as a platform to meet the needs of readers and illustrators. Every expense has been rigorously budgeted and accounted for, which is why it only costs $40,000 to develop a unique and innovative technology, help supporting young artists both financially and artistically, and at the same time paying for the book. You get 3 for the price of one!These rising young talents represent the best of the best from Toronto's top art schools, including OCAD and the University of Toronto. Some are also friends of mine when we studied together at UfT Art. A few are professional illustrators.If you're an artist and you like the whole idea, we would love to get you on the team. As long as there are sprint sessions available, we'll be glad to have you on board. (Please see the Project timeline above for more details on the format of the 2-day slots.) If not, the next book is only 3 months away.We've already finished half the book. Read the stories here: http://bookses.com"

1102," It has always been my dream to fill people's lives with beautiful, treasured things.  And I still dream, everyday of having a space to use as my creative outpouring, a little store perhaps. One filled with vintage inspired illustrations, upcycled furniture and the most delightful objects that have once been unwanted and now get a new life. I love recycling unwanted wooden boards, old paintings and old furniture, giving each piece my fullest attention and love in the process of transforming it into a shabby chic piece or a high fashion illustration. This project is my means of introducing people to a new way of capturing fashion, such as bridal. You send me a photo of say, your friend's dress and I do a high fashion take on it, still keeping the dress as the focus, and what an interesting gift to give, capturing the one special dress and having something to hang on the wall other than a photograph! Please note I will require the date you need the illustration ready by, taking into account the delivery  times, as well as an email with the photo of the dress and the colour scheme "

1105," About Me:ŒæMy name is Olivia Cox, but you may know me better as The Living Wiccan, a popular Pagan tumblr blog.Sigils are a big part of my craft work and as such, I've accumulated a large number of sigils -- each of them personally designed -- that span a large array of themes and ideas. I use them primarily in spell work; in warding, in altar decorations, at the front of books, above beds and doorframes. If you can name it, I've got a sigil there.Sigils are symbols, drawings, or designs that have specific meaning to their creator, in order to achieve a certain purpose. Sigils can be used for protection, love, money, cleansing, sacred spaces, confidence, courage.... the possibilities are endless.ŒæThey're an integral part of my witchcraft, and as such the level of detail and love that goes into each and every sigil design is unparalleled.About the Project:ŒæThe Sigilic Tarot is aŒæproject that I've had in mind for years now, but never figured out exactly how to make it work. Now that the vision is clear and the resources are available to produce such a unique deck, I'm asking for your help to get it started.The Sigilic Tarot is unique in its design, with 50 cards made up of 5 suits of 10 instead of the traditional 78 of major and minor arcana. Each suit represents a different aspect of our lives: ŒæThe deck also has a feature that not many other decks have - images laid right in the designs to tell you if the card's topic affects you, or those around you. This makes for extremely easy tarot reading. ŒæThe abstract art of the cards leads to readings that are full of interpretation, giving the tarot reader so much more independence to use their intuition. The cards aren't as rigidŒæas traditional decksŒæin their meanings vs. their art, causing a great sense of freedom for the user.The cards are designed in another spectacular way: not only do the images themselves make a beautiful divination experience, but the corners of the cards - the quarter-circles which indicate the suits - Œæalso line up to create unique sigils in between the cards, for a different mesmerizing read each time (see picture below!)ŒæŒæThis deck aims to have  an incomparable look to them that will be a must-have for any tarot enthusiast, reader, or collector. With your help, we can make that a reality!ŒæThe deck will, of course, also come with a book of meanings, instructions, and sample spreads for the new reader!ŒæŒæFor this project the 50-card deck will have  a limited print of 500. Once the 500 decks are sold out, they'll be gone forever (a long time!). All decks will come in a custom made cloth bag.About the Costs: The majority of the funds raised for this project will be put toward printing costs. Finding a reliable printing company for tarot decks is an expensive process! As this deck is also hand-designed, some funds will also go toward lino (for the original prints) and other art supplies. Other costs include shipping costs, shipping boxes, deck packaging, and Kickstarter fees.ŒæA very rough breakdown:Rewards!  The rewards portion of this KickstarterŒæis pretty fantastic, and offers something for everyone who wants to back this project.  IMPORTANT NOTE: All rewards can be shipped anywhere in the world outside Canada, so long as a $5 shipping fee is added.ŒæAll rewards are posted on the right side of the page and feature something for everyone. Anything from tarot readings to altar cloths, from garden banners to jewelry, there's definitely something that'll whet your apetite.ŒæStretch Goals:  Should the Kickstarter fund more than the original $12,000 goal, it benefits everyone!ŒæThe Art:Some selections of the artwork for your viewing pleasure, spanning all five suits!Œæ"

1107," Where the Wild Things Are is a children's book written by Maurice Sendak in 1963.ŒæI have always been a fan of ""Where the Wild Things Are.""Œæ The illustrations, especially, are interesting, slightly scary, and beautiful works of art.Œæ When I moved to Philadelphia eight months ago I visited a museum called The Rosenbach Museum and Library, which happens to have the largest collection of art and writings by Maurice Sendak, the visionary behind the popular children's book.Œæ Seeing a lot of his ideas, sketches, and final watercolors in person inspired me a great deal, and I have been interested ever since to re-create some of his iconic images.The project is just that: re-creating most (if not all) of the imagery from Where the Wild Things Are, though as silkscreens.Œæ I wish to do this initially to better acquaint myself with the art of silk screening and better hone my skills as a professional printmaker.Œæ Secondly, I wish to pay homage to Sendak by re-creating his artworks.Œæ Being that they will be silkscreens, they will be slightly different than the originals by Maurice Sendak, but will still have the same playful and beautiful imagery.Thirdly, the final images will be made into a hand-bound artists book with a strictly limited edition of 5 pieces.Œæ One of these books is for myself (of course), one is being donated to the Franklin Furnace Foundation in New York, a third is being donated into the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Œæ The remaining two will be available here.Great question. ŒæMaurice Sendak created the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" book in 1963. ŒæIt was and is to this day a classic. ŒæHis illustrations are incredible and even more powerful in person. ŒæSo why even re-make them? ŒæFor me, it's much more about a personal exploration of the characters and images. ŒæI enjoy them and during the process and creating the silkscreens, not only will I learn more about the characters and the book, but I will increase my skills as a professional artist and become a better silk screener. ŒæBeing that Sendak's original illustrations were pen & ink and watercolor, it is difficult to retain that amount of detail when transferring the medium over to silkscreen. ŒæHowever, as much attention to the incredible details is retained as possible. ŒæThe image below, for example, shows Max and some of the Wild Things in a march. ŒæThe close-up shot shows some of the details that were kept of the characters (from left to right) Ira, Douglas and Kw. ŒæDouglas, especially, has a great deal of details in his plumage and feathers. ŒæNow, lets be honest, this is the part most of you are here for: the rewards!Œæ There are several reward levels set up that include original silk screens from some of your favorite illustrations of the beloved children's classic. ŒæFor Twenty dollars, you will receive one 5"" x 7"" silkscreen of one of the following images from ""Where the Wild Things Are."" ŒæImage options include:""Max in his Wolf Suit""""Max Howling at the Moon""""The Sea Dragon""ForŒæthirty dollars, you will receive one 8"" x 10"" silkscreen. ŒæAn early bird special of this also allows the first ten people getting this reward to have it for only $25!Images options include:ŒæŒæ""Title page with Bull and text""""Max on his boat""""Carol""""Max and Carol with Balloon Heart"" (inspired by the movie, not the book)""Max Scaring Judith and Alexander""ForŒæsixty dollars, you will receive one of the large prints from the series. ŒæThese will be about 12"" x 20"" and will be any of the iconic ""double page"" illustrations featured in the book.Image options include:""Wild Rumpus""""Howling at the Moon""""Max sailing away on his boat""For two-hundred and fifty dollars, you will receive ALL of the 8"" x 10"" silkscreens. ŒæThese will come in a custom, hand-made portfolio which will be hand-signed and numbered. ŒæPlus, as a bonus, you will also receive an ""Kickstarter Exclusive"" print: a print of Max in his wolf suit, with a large ""K"" in the bottom left corner. ŒæThese are available only here through Kickstarter! Œæ(Only twenty of these complete sets are available!)Also, for $225 you can get all of the 12"" x 20"" pieces.Œæ These will not be in a portfolio, however, due to their odd size.Interested in the final product of the hand made book? ŒæTwo of these will be made available here, the other three are already gone. ŒæWhy $300 for a hand made book? ŒæFirstly, as mentioned the entire edition size is only 5 pieces. ŒæOne of these will stay in my collection. ŒæThe other two are already going to museum collections. ŒæOne of the books will be housed in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New Yorkäó_ so technically, you have the same artwork they have in their permanent collection.In a few of my latest projects here on Kickstarter, I have offered artwork world wide, without realize that shipping to Australia, Germany, etc is incredibly expensive. ŒæIf not living in the United States and you are interested, let me know and I will get a direct shipping quote for you. ŒæI wish shipping was cheaper, but it definitely isn't.Also, if there is an image that you are interested in and it is not available, just send me a message and we can work out a custom-created silk screen for you.ŒæI will also be adding additional rewards and perks as the fusing level increases. ŒæSome of these will include free prints to whomever donates a certain amount of money, etc.Since I launched this project I've gotten this question about a dozen times already.Œæ Yes, this is legal and I am not breaking any copyright laws.Œæ The images are not being stolen and re-copied, but altered into a different style, different kind of artwork and looks quite different (notice all of the backgrounds are not in my images).Œæ These changes on their own make this project not breaking any laws and copyrights."

I live in the great USA now and have been making a reasonable living as an artist. My name is Felix, but my friends call me Flex, so my artist name is ( Flex) and that is the name I paint under and sign on my paintings. I recently had the idea to put my art on trading cards, so Flex Borin Collectible Trading Cards are traditional 2.5'' x 3.5'' Trading Cards depicting some of my paintings. You can get a better view of these on my website www.FlexBorin.comŒæIŒæestimate the cost of printing, production, packaging, marketing and distribution should be around $25,000. The cards you see in the presentation video are a part of a series. Every year I will release a new series of collectible trading cards. My goal is to have my trading cards in every store and all other venues where trading cards of all kinds are bough, sold and traded. Be it specialty hobby stores or any of the big box chain stores.  I have all that is needed set in place and ready to go, minus the money to pay for it all.  All printing, distributors, and marketing is just waiting for me to pull the trigger on this project. I have most of the cards printed, but the packaging and marketing will take more money then I have at my disposal, so that is why I'm here to ask for your help and contributions. Œæ"

1110," The media often portrays Detroit with negative images of poverty and urban blight. Our goal is to express a positive image of Detroit and show the world how great the city really is today. The funds raised will cover the cost of an artist, the printing of thousands of posters and a dedicated landing page with the artwork. We have done two posters of Detroit in the late eighties and still see them framed on walls today. The content of this new illustration will be different in that it will not include the suburbs, just downtown and midtown Detroit. We are working with many local businesses and organizations to create a classic piece of art that will put Detroit in the best possible light. With the printed poster distribution, online exposure and social media strategy, we will help Detroit continue to thrive, one positive image at a time. Join the cause!"

1112," Hello. I am a sixteen year old girl from Oakland, California. I love art, and I am always looking for new opportunities to share my passion with the rest of the world. I have found that street fairs and art shows are the most effective ways for me to get my illustrations out there. Unfortunately, the expenses for these activities are aŒætad pricey for a teen on a budget.Your donations would go towards paying for the various booth fees, table and chair rentals, and necessary matting and framing expenses.A bit about my process and creations:The history of the brounie can be traced to the folklore of ancient northern England and Scotland. Back then, brounies were unseen imps that helped around the house, and of course, they also had a mischievous side. They ate porridge and honey and were likely to disappear if given anything else as payment.In my creative mind,ŒæbrouniesŒæhave taken on the modern world and adapted to some of the odd customs of our time. Sometimes brounies look identical to their master -- or they may have physical attributes in common -- but most often they take on one or two of the character traits their person possesses. For example, a human who enjoys omelets may have a brounie with chicken-like qualities. My favorite medium is pen and ink. My art markers are my babies. I take care of them as such. I draw my inspiration for my artwork from colorful children's shows and current Japanese culture.Your donations would be greatly appreciated!"

I want children to look at my alphabet tree in wonder of all the illustrations for each letter.

Featuring a positive Black female heroine, these contemporary fantasy stories based on Egyptian mythology have built a small following of readers of all ages in paperback and eBook over the past year and a half all over the world.While most customers have enjoyed the stories in the Isis series, some have complained about the art on the covers. Due to financial reasons Iäó»ve been drawing the covers myself over the past year.  Being out of work these past five years, I just donäó»t have the money to hire a professional artist.I know many readers judge books by their covers. And to leave that powerful first impression on them so they will give the Isis series a try, Iäó»d like to hire a professional artist to draw, ink and color the cover for the next book in the Isis series: Isis: Wrath of the Cybergoddess.The concept cover Iäó»ve drawn up features two figures and a I want to feature a minimal background. I estimate the cost to be around $500 to hire a professional artist to draw up and color the cover for the paperback and eBook editions. If I can move past the $500 benchmark I can see about trying to put an insert or two in between the pages of the paperback and the digital editions.Help me take the Isis series to the next level. In a sci-fi/fantasy world of mostly White heroines such as Wonder Woman, Batgirl, Supergirl, She-Ra, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Xena: Warrior Princess, I created Isis so little Black girls would have their own heroine featured in fantasy adventures they could identify and relate to.

1121," THE WHYI have had this dream of creating a journal with illustrations reflecting the mood spectrum for some time. ŒæThere may be days when I don't feel like writing, but if I can circle or mark an illustration that reflects my mood, I will have achieved something. ŒæIn the Mood...a journal for those whose moods swing! has illustrations on each page showing the range of moods, from the deepest, darkest depression to the most ecstatic-on-the-verge-of-psychotic, manic. ŒæEven the mixed mood - I'm sad but my thoughts are racing a mile a minute - has a spot. ŒæAnd for additional interest, illustrations which tie in with quotations by poets and writers which reflect our experience are sprinkled throughout, on a ratio of two illustrations to one quote. ŒæNaturally, we're leaving lots of room to write!Recently, the World Health Organization suggested we keep track of our moods in its video: Œæ""I had a black dog, his name was Depression."" Œæwww.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCrniLQGYcŒæ While this video speaks to depression only, Sarah's illustrations encompass the entire span.The illustrator, my daughter Sarah, is not only a gifted artist but is uniquely qualified to illustrate these moods as she has witnessed them firsthand.

Just check out Wikipedia's List of People with Bipolar Disorder -en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_bipolar_disorder - and you'll see I'm in good company!THE HOWThis is where you come in. ŒæThe finances will be used to publish the journal and market it worldwide. ŒæI feel anyone can use this journal and have fun doing so. ŒæIt will take within 90 - 120 days from the time the publisher receives the manuscript to having printed copies available.WHAT HAPPENS IF WE'RE OVERFUNDED?We want this journal to be an international success.

I wanted to add to the vintage feel of Steampunk by using a tin case instead of a tuck box to house the cards.Œæ Œæ Œæ As an artist, I love working with the different paper textures, feeling the textures each of the different paper has, and creating new colors by overlaying more transparent papers on top. I used this technique to create this Steampunk deck. Before creating the collages, I handpainted the backgrounds using water colors and after completion, I then digitally created the borders.Œæ Œæ ŒæThis has been such an awesome project make and create and hope that you will enjoy playing with them as well. My goal is to have each deck in a good loving home. The Printer has given an estimated production time of 3.5 weeks for this deck. Shipping is estimated to take 2 weeks and once I have them I can begin placing my cards in their homes with you.ŒæWill also be posting more images of cards as support increases.Œæat 25 backers will post an image of kingsat 50 backer will post an image of numbersat 75 backers will post an image of jacksat 100 backers will post an image of jokersat 125 backers will post an image of Aces"

1127," As a licensed K-12 Visual Art teacher, I have spent the last two years primarily focused on my students and curriculum.Œæ Now, it is time I invest in my art.Œæ While I frequently draw, paint, and work with fibers, my greatest passion is for printmaking processes.Œæ This project is designed to begin approaching printmaking as my primary medium for art production.Before I can begin printing, I need to establish a setup with the proper equipment.Œæ The funds raised through this project will fund the initial cost to acquire necessary equipment.Œæ This equipment will serve a purpose far greater than this one project.Œæ It will be the foundation for years of printing and editions to come.Œæ Once the tools have been acquired, the space will be setup.Œæ Then the real fun begins!I have already developed a range of images to create as printed artworks.Œæ Two have been selected as the initial editions to create with the new printing press.The first, Balloon Ride, will be a linoleum cut edition.Œæ It will be created as a suicide print with two colors.Œæ This means after the first color has been printed, I will carve away from the same block to print the second color.Œæ It will be a limited edition of 15 prints and can never be reprinted.Œæ With an estimated image size of 9"" x 12"", this will be the smaller of my two editions.The second edition, Seeking Wisdom, will be a woodcut printed edition. At approximately 12"" x 18"", the scale of this piece will land on the larger end of my printmaking spectrum.Œæ It will be another suicide print edition, this time in three colors.Œæ This limited edition of 15 prints can never be reprinted.The reality is that prints inherently appear different from drawings.Œæ They vary stylistically, based upon the process through which the image is created.Œæ For a better understanding of how the completed editions may appear, take a look at my 2011 prints Mismatched Socks and Just Your Puppet.Other examples of my work can be viewed at my Facebook page or on Etsy."

1129," The immediate goal of this project is to create a tarot deck that is based on the unique underlying structure that I have created with the philosophy described on my web site: www.palmprints.com. The larger, more ambitious goal is to create a deck that will surpass the extremely popular Rider/Waite/Smith deck in popularity and cause my underlying structure, and template of intended meanings, to become the de facto standard, or new paradigm, that every future artist of tarot uses as a guide for drawing future decks. This will require hiring a really amazing artist/illustrator who will collaborate with me to incorporate the best features of decks that I have drawn myself in the past, as well as anything that might be useful from traditional tarot decks, to create a master hybrid deck that says everything I need it to say. Lots of people buy tarot decks just for the artwork. I need to hire someone with some real talent who can create a really amazing deck; a deck so amazing that mainstream publishers of tarot decks will want to publish it, rather than me having to publish it myselfäó_ a deck so amazing that people devoted to tradition will buy it just for the art, and thenäó_ maybeäó_ some dayäó_ take the time one day to examine it further for what it has to offer the world of tarot as a new paradigm and better operating system.With a really amazing deck in hand, I can then promote my new paradigm in ways that gets attention from tarot traditionalists who might be open to exploring a new way of looking at tarot. I have some of my decks available on a print-on-demand web site. But I really need a super amazing deck that is professionally printed and for general sale through a popular publisher of tarot decks to give me some credibility as an alternative and allow people to use my system.If I can't get a traditional publisher of tarot to publish my deck even after being drawn by an amazing artist, I can self publishing using the on-demand options. There is not much profit to be made this way, but it is an option that would at least get the artwork out there for people to use.The even longer term goal of this project is to get the entire contents of my web site published as a book, so that all the ideas held within don't die with me, but can live on, on someone's bookshelf, long after I've croaked and stopped paying Yahoo! to host my site. Until then, I give away all my ideas online. It would be great to meet an artist who would want to make this deck just for the fun of it and for the exposure that would result from people using it, and thereby be able to give it away for free. But finding artists willing to work for fun or even speculated profits is not easy. I need to have something to offer them as incentive.I've consulted with a few artist in order to get estimates of cost. Some say they would do it for $100 per image. Others estimate much higher, like $400 or $700 or more! There are 74 cards in my deck (plus designing some title cards and a box). If I can get someone to do this for $300 per image that would be $22,200. So, as instructed, I've included a bit more in my proposal to cover the costs of rewards. I'm keeping this total low, so that I might reach the goal and have *something* to offer *someone*. But at a low rate, it might be hard to attract the best of the best. So, if you find this project compelling and want me to be able to hire the very best, pledge a lot, because if more funding comes in, I might be able to attract an even better artist.I've figured that having an artist on board already might be better. They could certainly help in soliciting funds. And people might want to know who the artist is before backing the project. But I am hoping that the proposal itself will attract someone. If not, I will be out looking myself and let you know if I find anyone interested in doing this for this amount. Otherwise, this is about funding my ability to hire any artist I can, whether my choice is popular with the people funding the project or not. Help me hire *someone*!"
1130," I think every artist hits a point where they feel stuck on a plateau development-wise äóñ or worse yet, feel like theyäó»re backsliding and losing some of what theyäó»ve learned previously. Thatäó»s where I find myself. The pressures and frustrations with my day job have long been keeping me from sketching.  I end up with little drive to draw and feel that if I am going to draw, it has to be something great.  Fear of it not being so has kept me from sketching at all.  Itäó»s a vicious cycle to be in, and this project is meant to put an end to it.  Iäó»m giving myself permission to draw badly. A multitude of great artists of the past are credited with the concept, but it bears repeating and the original source appears to be Walt Stanchfield.  I know I heard it from at least one teacher at college and Iäó»m sure every art student has heard some variation of it: Everybody has 10,000 bad drawings in them.  The best way to handle all those bad drawings is to get them out as soon as possible. So - I am resetting the count and starting over from zero.  My goal is to do ten thousand sketches in as short a time as possible.  Hopefully by the end of 2014 Iäó»ll be done, but it may take longer.  Ultimately, it will help me relearn that thereäó»s nothing shameful about äóìdrawing badlyäó.  Every sketch from a 30 second gesture to a polished drawing is a learning opportunity.  And all those sketches will be put on display on my blog, Dare to Draw Badly (WARNING: contains life drawing, which means artistic nudity.Œæ It's flagged as NSFW to be on the safe side, but if that kind of thing bothers you, don't visit!). My progress can be viewed at http://daretodrawbadly.tumblr.comŒæ What kind of sketches am I doing?This is going to be a long, work-intensive project and Iäó»m sure that the nature of what I draw is going to shift over time as I feel more confident in certain subject matter and move on to new, less familiar territory.  Iäó»m starting with the basics äóñ drawing from life, using online tools to do figure drawing for both humans and animals.Later on, I may be sketching from memory or using my more solid knowledge of anatomy to create images of strange fantasy creatures.Œæ Generally, the sketches will fall under these categories:Gestures (30 second to two minute sketches).  The goal is to capture the essence of the pose, with little in terms of detail.  Generally done on newsprint pads. Human gesture example: http://www.dragonfyredawn.com/kickstarter/jan5figures2.jpgAnimal gesture example: http://www.dragonfyredawn.com/kickstarter/jan9cats2.jpgSketches (5-10 minutes).  Quick sketches where shading and form is paid more attention if the lighting source of the subject allows it.  If the lighting source isnäó»t conductive to blocking in shading, focus is primarily on proportions and foreshortening.  Generally done on newsprint pads. Sketch example: http://www.dragonfyredawn.com/kickstarter/jan8figures6.jpgDrawings (longer studies).  More attention is paid to detail, or the drawings is of more complicated subject matter.  Can be done on newsprint, in a sketchbook or on higher quality paper.Drawing example: http://www.dragonfyredawn.com/kickstarter/jan7skulls1.jpgSo why the Kickstarter? The goal amount is modest, intended to cover the supplies Iäó»ll inevitably need when I run through the sketchbooks and pencils I have stashed away.Œæ I'll be burning through dozens of newsprint pads, roughly one per week - at $3 apiece, the cost will be adding up quickly.Œæ At nearly 200 sketches in, I'm also putting a noticeable dent in my pencil supply, so I may have to get a new set every 1000 drawings or so.Œæ The remainder of the goal amount takes into consideration Kickstarter and Amazon fees, taxes and shipping for any physical rewards due to backers.Anything above the goal amount will help give me opportunity to sketch things I canäó»t find on-hand at home or through free venues.Œæ When the weather gets warmer, I can take trips to zoos, aquariums and museums to sketch.  Additionally, anything over the goal amount will also help compensate me for the time it's taking to tackle this project.Œæ Nobody likes being a starving artist, after all!How this will work There are no true stretch goals.  Each dollar backed is its own mini stretch goal äóñ think of each dollar as äóìI dare you to do a sketchäó.  While I will attempt to do all ten thousand, each cumulative dollar will guarantee Iäó»ll get at least that many sketches done, up to the full ten thousand.  If the amount goes over that, it just means Iäó»ll start getting more than $1 per sketch done and have more opportunity to expand my horizons with field trips.Œæ If this project really gets a ton of support, I may even be able to quit that day job and take this on as a full-time project until it's done.

Children will love looking at each letter of the alphabet and finding intricately drawn items, each beginning with the letter which contains it (see below for more information). My hope is that children will have fun exploring the drawings while learning about the alphabet. I will also add fun rhyming words on each page, to keep the interest of early readers and pre-school children.YOU get to choose the title of each drawing and I will draw it, each drawing will be the size of the square you purchased, but could be intermingled with other drawings such as in the one below.ŒæCheck out the progress on the updatesŒælink or catch a closer look on Instagram.How can you contribute?With your help, I will self-publish the ""Alphadoodle"" book, once I have the whole alphabet done. The funds you provide will cover expenses for publishing to Amazon in print and in eBook format, various marketing expenses and the Kickstarter and Amazon fees that come with using this website. We will begin with the letter 'A' and once the squares in that letter are filled with artwork I'll continue through the alphabet.ŒæYou can be a backer by purchasing a 1"" square section of the grid or purchaseŒæseveral sections if you prefer.ŒæThen you can nominate a topic for me to draw into the square in the appropriate part of the alphabet.ŒæRequests will be collated, interpreted and added to the 'letter' and included in the book.Œæeg: If you purchase 4 squares and say 'cat', the drawing will take up 4 squares and will be enclosed in the letter 'C'.ŒæNOTE: You can fund several squares and just nominate one word (the drawing will be as large as the squares you purchase) or nominate a word for each square that you purchase.Tip: This is a children's book so simplicity is good and offensive suggestions will not be included.How will you follow progress?I am a great project managerso I'll keep you up to date with progress by uploading progress shots so you can see what you have purchased.What's in it for you?If you pledge $20 or over I will give you a high resolution copy of the letter you chose to contribute to OR a letter of your choice.Why am I doing this book?I'm an avid artist who has illustrated 3 children's books (and written one of them too).

1132," I LOVE CHICKENS! I hope you do too.Œæ This project has really been years in the making. I have been drawing chickens of one sort or another for the past 12 years. I even had two backyard chickens of my own for a while when I lived in Austin. It was a sweet, comical, and complicated relationship. They didn't behave like pets, and everything wanted to eat them...So my job of keeping them safe was difficult.They were both red, and so I named them Lucy #1 and #2. I eventually had to give them up, but I'll never forget theŒæexperience of caring for theseŒæurban chickens. Here's a little video with some other chickens, and more examples of my artwork. And the Lucy's are in there too.The Chicken Scratchin' book is a continuation of my scratchboard drawing education (and what I like to call ""Linda's Scratchboard Empire""). I'm an art school drop-out-- by allowing me to draw your birds and tell your stories I get to be a better artist/author. And by sharing your stories, the world can appreciate and understand more about these wonderful creatures. Don't worry if you have more than one, I can squeeze at leastŒæthree on the 5""x7"" board. Don't have chickens? You can 'sponsor' your family, friends and neighbors chickens. See how easy that is?This isn't going to be a book about the different breeds and how to raise them--there are plenty of those out there already. Simply, it will be full of my fun, colorful drawings and your stories about your birds.Here's an example of what the cover may look like:ŒæHere's an example of two page layout: ŒæThe finished soft-cover book will be 6""x9"" and printed in the USA.

1138," Introducing a set of original art images that showcases the traditional as well as the alternative sides of the female form. THE ART...My goal was to create a distinctive set of images that would stand out. A body of work with an Arc. The pieces are rendered with a combination of traditional and computer art tools. Using a realistic style to depict something both alluring and provocative, even mysterious. I tried to avoid the standard clichí©s in effort to produce something genuine, a little challenging, that hopes to widen the range of what is gets depicted (particularly in regards to the female form) in visual art by offering a spectrum from the traditional to the alternative representations. Note: some images do depict nudity, so please be aware.Why Kickstarter?I've turned to Kickstarter to ask for support in bringing this series to life largely due to its directness with an audience. I've found that my work does not fit neatly into the predefined structures of the present art world. The images and subject matter don't fall in line with modern or commercial Art environments easily. So I'm trying a new method for bringing art out to the public. Attempting a new paradigm that's built around new ideas and new technology. I believe in this new era and its ability to help realize goals, fund projects, and help find new audiences. The best way to achieve all that I think begins here...The Project...The goal is simple. To get the funding needed to produce such large size formatted prints of this collection of art work by offering rewards in the form of normal-to-small sized formatted prints and clothing. THE REWARDS!I've tried to keep the Rewards for backing this project hopefully very simple and straight forward. There could be something that I might have forgotten or a detail that I've overlooked, if I find an error or mistake I will make a comment or correction in the update section. The rewards offered for funding my project are Art Prints that will be printed with archival ink on paper ranging in size from the smallest 8.5"" by 11"", next size up 14"" by 20"" and then the largest size offered 30"" by 40"". Note: depending on the monitor settings for the device used in viewing the images there might be a slight color differential from the actual art work.Here are the images offered...Note: the black borders are for presentation only and NOT part of the actual art work.Here are the two T-shirts offered, colors are black and white, and this is the image that will be used plus the proposed mock ups...THANK YOU!Thanks for your interest!

1140," The East Idaho Aquarium is a non-profit organization. We are currently working on acquiring our tax exempt status from the IRS. Once we get our tax exemptstatus, will go all out trying to find grants in order to bring this aquarium to Eastern Idaho. Many people have called us asking if this project is forreal, if this is something that is actually going to happen. They wanted to makesure we are not a bunch of teenagers just making a joke and gettingpeoples hopes up. Well the East Idaho Aquarium is a real thing and it isactually going to happen. Arron Faires, the president of the aquarium, has beeneagerly working on this project since February 2013. His desire to operate apublic aquarium dates all the way back to his early years in high school. As I was growing up, my family had fish. It was something I would help my mom with when I was little. I was too young to remember, but she told me I used to love watching our Angelfish. My first memory of my family having fish was our community fish tank.My familywent to the store and bought a bunch of fish for our little ten gallon tank. My three brothers and I each got to pick a different kind of fish to add to the tank. I remember picking the Neon Tetras. However, they did not live very long because we made a few mistakes. Our next twofish to go into the tank were a Betta and a Goldfish. When the Betta died, we gavethe Goldfish away and bought Guppies. The Guppies were very fun to watch and werealways having babies. This is the tank I remember helping my mom clean from time totime. I did not get seriously into fish though until much later. When I was a Junior in High School I earned my Eagle Scout, and as a reward my parents bought me a 29 gallonfish tank. A couple of years before I was given the 29 gallon tank, I had really wanted some Oscars. When I was told how large Oscars grew to be, I was not able to getthem. So once I got that bigger tank, I went and picked out two Oscars for my tank. Igot a Red Oscar and a Tiger Oscar, which were my pride and joy at the time. Whenmy friends would come over we would feed them Goldfish; we thought they were socool. My grandma later gave me a fish book and on the cover of the book was a beautiful Turquoise Discus. I really wanted to get one, but after a little bit ofresearch I realized they were very hard to take care of. It then became my goal toone day own a Discus. I wanted to be good enough at fish keeping to beable to care for the ""king of fish"" in the freshwater fish world. I would goto the library and check out fish books. I soon fell in love with planted tanks. Thethings people could do with live plants in an aquarium was amazing. I set it asone of my goals to have a beautiful planted tank. I tried for years to growlive plants with no real success. People would always tell me how cool the Denver aquarium was. They told me it was like a zoo, but all it had was fish. My dream job then became to own a public aquarium, but I dismissed it as just adream. I figured you needed lots of money to open something like that. Iknew I wanted to do something with fish though; I wanted to either study them, breed them, or sellthem.. After a few years I accumulated several tanks. At one time I had two 55 gallons, a 28 gallon bow front, a 29gallon, two 10 gallons, and a few bowls with various fish. I think everyoneshould own a least two big tanks; a tank with large fish and a communitytank. There is nothing like either. When I got married I thought my wife wasgoing to make me get rid of all my tanks. The opposite of what I thought actually occurred. She ended up liking fish too, just not as much as me. Although,not verymany people like fish as much as I do. One of the best things that happened tome was when I got hired at Petsmart. When I was first hired I thought forsure I would get to work in the fish department, but instead they made me a supplystocker. I long waited for the day when they would put me in the fish department. Itseemed like whenever an employee would quit from that part of the store, the position would be filled with someone who knew nothing about fish. It wasfunny because the new people would always ask me why I was not working with thefish, but I never could give them a good answer. Anytime a customer asked them aquestion they could not answer, they would come find me and ask me if Iknew the answer. I always did. During the time I was a stocker, there was anemployee who owned his own fish cleaning business. He recognized my passion forfish and hired me on to help him. During this time I learned how to grow liveplants. He taught me about certain types of water and water chemistry. Hehelped me start my path to reaching my goals of owning a Discus and having a beautifullyplanted tank. I now own Discus and have been told by many that I have beautifully plantedtanks. After a year of stocking, I finally got my chance to work in the fishdepartment. Customers always told me how it was a relief to have somebody thatactually knew what they were talking about. There were times that people wouldline up waiting to talk to me. Other associates would try to help those customers, but theywould decline the associates help and tell them they were waiting for me. When I wouldnot work,people would come into the store to see if I was there and upon finding outI was not they would turn around and leave. Not only did I help lots of people,but many people that would come in taught me new things.Œæ I learned way more from other peoples experiences, than I did in all the years of reading and studying fish on my own. One of my best qualities is that I am never afraid to learn new things. I havenever been one to think that I know it all. The person that hired me to helphim clean tanks came to me one day and said we should open an aquarium. Hetold me how the Boise aquarium had been set up and how we could set one up too. I thought,""Awesome we can do this!"". More importantly, however; I can do this without needing millionsof dollars. We started a non-profit organization called the East Idaho Aquarium in Marchof 2013. I found out in August that he no longer wanted to be part of the East Idaho Aquarium. Afterhis quitting, I found a team to help me. Since getting my team together, more work was done for the Aquarium in one month than in the first five months with my original partner. Other than fish I like frisbee, soccer, football, basketball, and spending time with my wife and twolittle girls. The East Idaho Aquarium is hoping to secure the locationwhere the old Game World was. We like this location because of the heavy foottraffic that it receives. The location would allow for people to catch a movie,go to the aquarium, and eat lunch/dinner. If we do get this location then thecity of Ammon has told us they could waive our utility bill. Floor plans to theaquarium are being put together for this location. There is a high probabilitythis will be the location of the aquarium, but nothing is set in stone. The person that is building our aquariums says he will needaround six months to build all of the aquariums that we are wanting. Wereally want to be opened in the summer of 2014. The rough price estimate of theseaquariums is $88,000. Many large companies will only donate to non-profit organizations thatare tax exempt. We are waiting for the IRS to give us our tax exempt status, but have been told the soonest we could get it is January. So insteadof waiting, we are pursuing our goal to be opened by the summer. To do this weneed your help. To raise some of these funds we decided to make shirts. We drew up some cool designs. These designs will only be available to our early kickstarter supporters.ŒæTo show our appreciation of your early support, when you buy a shirt, and wear  it to the aquarium you will receive 50% off the entrance price. Anytime you come in with your shirt on you will receive 50% off, so buy one for each member of your family. The shirts are $20. Once we open up shirts like these will sell for $25 and no discount will be given. All proceeds of the shirts will go to the building of the aquarium. The only shirts that will have the 50% off discount will be the shirts with the shark, stingray, and jellyfish pictured on them. The plain EIA shirt will not come with the 50% off discount. When you purchase a shirt please tell us the size you would like. If you do not we will send you a largeŒæ The East Idaho Aquarium needs yourhelp! If we do not reach our goal, then we will not be able to bring theseawesome shirts to you, and we will have to put off opening the aquarium a fewmore months. This offer will only be available once. So tell everybody you know,and get one for all your family members. "
1141," AlphaFresh was born out of a frustration with the greetings card market and the lack of fun, cool or super-awesome cards available.

1149," INTO MYSTERY began on December 12, 2012 (12:12 and 12 sec to be precise) and since our first project launch we have scoured the Kickstarter pages for talented people we hoped would collaborate with us to form a larger INTO MYSTERY creative team beyond our own office. We hoped they might help deliver the second half of our project clues.  Of course, it never is as simple as just asking people to participate; believe me, we have, and it doesn't quite work the way one might imagine.  Instead, we backed and supported each one of their projects - one, because we loved what they were doing, but two, Kickstarter is a wonderful way to meet creative people; to grow a potential working relationship through the intersection of so many creative disciplines. We are proud to be able to continue our work with the full talents of artists that we have found solely through or on Kickstarter. Our KickArtists are contributing INTO MYSTERY in their own incredible way and again, we turn to you for assistance in helping this grow, both creatively and in the number of opportunities we have for the next set of nine project clues. PLEASE help us support three parts of Clue 09:Please help us to expand our minds and to take this for a single ride in the upmost, creative, inspiring way that just might set a MONUMENTAL example for generations to come; please help us kick this Gumguzzler (as Abigail Howard might say) INTO MYSTERY.Your support rewards you with all of the current clues, access to Clue 09 Chamber and some of the most imaginative work from the following artists that will lead you straight through the back door and INTO MYSTERY.Hal and Marilyn Weiner make incredible documentaries and films. Last summer, they were raising money for their Extreme Realities television series on Kickstarter while I was simultaneously looking for someone to guide us through our own INTO MYSTERY documentary for Clue 10. It took some convincing, but after backing their project, sorting through some logistics, a few intro phone calls, some wonderful meals together and after many, many cryptic conversations, Hal and Marilyn agreed to help us. We couldn't be more excited and honored to be working with such kind and distinguished filmmakers.I found Neil Dvorak (aka KeyMaster) and his super creative, comic and animation, Kickstarter campaign, Easy Pieces,Œæback in August of 2013. ŒæI so enjoyed his style and witty sensibility (especially his head popping off) that I backed his project (I am receiving a two hour animation class - wahoo), left aŒæcommentŒæand emailed him to set up a call to see if he was interested in collaborating on Clue 12. ŒæThe rest has mainly been Neil's intensive work on concept design, storyboards, filming, audio, animating, editing, etc. and we can't wait for you to see our collaborative efforts in the introductory INTO MYSTERY: Clue 12 airport video. Beatboxin', flashmob, and maybe some celebrity dancing . . . that's all I can say, other than, I hope we knock your heads off (like Neil's head in his video)! ŒæGreg Tull and Monica Tull of Monitogo Studios LLC are crazy impressive. An ambitious full feature, animated LEGO brick film, Bound, completed on Kickstarter, led me to our collaboration. Their compulsion to detail, obsessive scheduling and their self-taught, amazing talent which lends itself perfectly to their craft of animating meticulously constructed LEGO sets, scenery and action of their own invention is a perfect match to our love of LEGO. I wish for oh-so-many collaborations in the years to come with these fine folks, but for now, Clue 11 is blessed with their brickmaster talent.ŒæThe ever talented Alex Marvar was found launching her new film project, When in Belen, where she followed hundreds of clowns into the amazon! I am no stranger to her multi-talented gifts of writing, photography, music, journalism and connector of all things amazing; she was part of our 212box team from 2010 to 2012 and though she won't admit it, she has been pivotal in shaping INTO MYSTERY from the fledgling days of its existence. Regardless, her Kickstarter project allowed us to collaborate on our new INTO MYSTERY website which we are looking forward to showing you. Alex is also, by trade, a KeyMaster - be sure to look closely at her Kickstarter page.Three thousand, three hundred and twenty-four Kickstarter Backers fell in love with Abigail Howard for her Last Halloween comic strip and I was no exception. Granted, I cheated a bit when I forced a collaboration with Abby by backing at a reward tier level that included ""a 4-page comic based on something you find terrifying or disturbing"". In a unique style that only Abigail has mastered, I received a perfect email request for my worst possible terror and my reply was simple: if, and only if, Clue 18 was not successfully backed, that is my only worst fear and horror. Now, I know you won't let that happen, but if it did, Abigail will describe the horrific series of events that may occur. Please jump INTO MYSTERY and discover her talents, they are terrifically terrible and amazing.More ""Outside Kickstarter"" Artists need to get kicked INTO MYSTERY and we kindly ask for your help again. Clue 09: KickArt is all about kickstarting INTO MYSTERY KickArtists; support our support of artists and unique individuals on and off Kickstarter; through the duration of this project (and the following +/- 7 - 10 years). We want to create so many more experiences for you, the backer, that will have a deeper, larger effect; to deliver the essence and fulfill the meaning of what Kickstarter has begun in a relatively short time span - crowdsourcing creative endeavors. Let us, together, stretch the possibilities of what we can all do together, PLEASE!My hope for a collaboration withŒæCybíÂle Young has been a long time coming, and I couldn't be more excited to share in our INTO MYSTERY joint effort of story telling. We propose the following collaborative process:This man is the finest artist I have known for half of my life. Period. (btw, his attempts at Buddhist Thought & Value will still earn him a C- for attendance) ŒæWe propose the following collaborative process:This man needs no introduction, though I offer a quick teaser for any LEGO Architecture fan - and PLEASE, hold on to your LEGO hats and check out Clue 11 in March.Might we, as a Kickstarter community, steer the future involvement of the following hopeful KickArtists? ŒæPLEASE discover our wish list of candidates in the below riddles and if you know someone who knows someone who might convince them to kindly jump INTO MYSTERY with us, we would be ever so grateful. Please note: We reward KickArtist Kickers with one spectacular key reward that can only be found INTO MYSTERY. Thanks in advance.(My favorite part of INTO MYSTERY has been meeting all of our KickArtists and the crazy chance encounters of overlapping interests - but nothing compares to the author of the below riddles - Christian Haunton is a Clue 01 Backer (by chance) of INTO MYSTERY and he claims our chairman title of all things INTO MYSTERY; learn about his story in Clue 10!

1150," Hello Kickstarter! My name is Adrian Giacoletto.Iam an industrial engine mechanic here in beautiful Western Colorado. TheI'd Rather Be Motorboatin' design was born almost four years ago! My friendsTom and Jesse came up with this idea and made vinyl decals for their toolboxes.Ifirst saw their decal two years ago, and at first it was just another sticker. However, after they explained it to me...I realized just how funny it is! They created something truly amazing.ŒæSoI made a deal with them and it is my job to help take this idea to market (keep in mind I made this deal over two years ago).Whathas taken soooo long? Well honestly I didn't know where to start.ŒæI'd like totake second to say thanks to my virtual mentors. Dave Ramesy and Dan Miller. IfI never would have found these guys, this would still be just another""good idea"". Thisis where we need your help! Our goal is to take this design to Country JamColorado this year. We are looking to sell the same items posted here, but weneed the funding for the booth and our supplies.Thisproject is very personal to me. I made a commitment to my pals a long time ago.It's not just about a design. It's about me being able to follow through. I've had manychallenges during the last two years that has made it easy for me to make excuses not to start. WellI'm through with excuses!

1153," Our Galaxy.Œæ Hello Kickstarters! ŒæWe operate a small business in the heart of Sonoma Valley wine country (Vineyard Custom Art & Engraving). ŒæOur mission is to innovate creative laser-engraved products for local wine businesses. We engrave wine bottles, glasses and barrelhead ""Lazy Susan Cheeseboards"" for local wineries, and other items for weddings and events, including placemats, coasters, invitations, ""Save-the-Date"" cards, event marquees, and an assortment of party favors.The Tribute! ŒæŒæA while ago, I began thinking about what might be the quintessential laser creation that would capture the beauty of the hills, valleys, and vineyards of Sonoma and Napa counties, and, at the same time, illustrate our wine regions with a collection of iconic and detailed artistic imprints. ŒæI asked my wine country savvy wife and kids to help me noodle on a laser-engraved ""Sonoma-Napa Wine Country Tribute"" project.Eureka - The Project! Œæ What surfaced from our thinking was a limited edition collection of cartographically engraved ""coaster maps"", ""dinner place maps"", ""wine glassŒæmaps"", and ""wine barrelhead maps""; each depicting the Sonoma and Napa wine appellations as well as the specific American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) within the appellations. It so happens that Sonoma and Napa wine appellations each contain 16 distinct AVAs, a numerical balance of AVAs within the two counties.With functionality and art in mind, we developed plans to source the 32 AVAs to artists who could render cartographic maps with unique regional images that project and encompass the Sonoma and Napa county appellations. We named the project the:Œæ LimitedEdition Sonoma & Napa Appellations ""Wine Map Series"".This Project Takes Talent and Technology! ŒæWe operate a new 50-watt commercial quality laser engraver that can reliably and quickly produce the volume of items in each collection. We also have local artists and graphic designersŒæwho are committed to creating the images and icons representing the various Sonomaand Napa appellations and viticultural areas.With talent and technology in hand,Œæwe have started to engrave initial drawings on leather, glass, and wood. We've sized the coasters and placemats, and considered different shapes (square,round, and oval) for the Series components. We've shared our Limited EditionŒæconcepts with family members, friends, and neighbors from the local wine industry to get their feedback, and we're enthused by the encouragement we received for the project - everyone wants a part of the Series!Let's Map Out the Series. ŒæOur Limited Edition Sonoma-Napa Appellations ""Wine Map Series""Œæblends art and functionto create a collectable Series that serves as a conversation piece aboutCalifornia viticulture, highlighting two of theŒæmost visited wine destinations inthe world.A full set of either theSonoma or NapaŒæSeries consists of sixteen (16) cartographically laser engraved leather Coaster Mapsä‹¢Œæ(square or round-shaped); an oak barrel stave Coaster Holder with aleather engraved Marquee Appellation Map; four leather Dinner Place Mapsä‹¢Œæengraved with either the Sonoma Appellation Map or the Napa Appellation MapŒæ(eitherrectangular or oval-shaped), and; four 20 oz. Wine Glass Mapsä‹¢, again engraved with eitherthe Sonoma Appellation Map or the Napa Appellation Map,depending on the Series you select. ŒæA Limited Edition of Barrelhead Mapsä‹¢Œæ(Lazy Susan Cheeseboards) is also available in the ""Wine Map Series"". And, finally, for your fury friends,Œæwe are adding a Limited Edition of the Canine-Cat Maps with collars that show either the Sonoma or Napa Appellation Maps. The Canine-Cat map will generate comment after comment as you walk your pets or dress them for special events and competitions. Watch for a prototype in the next update.Your guests, wine aficionados or novices, will quickly recognize or learn the Sonoma and Napa appellations and AVAs when they see them on our Series maps at your dinner table.The Designs and Colors!Œæ The designs for each appellation and the viticultural areas within each appellation start with the physical cartography of the area and then areenhanced through the artwork of local artists commissioned to generate an indigenousand unique image, logo or icon representing the AVA.ŒæEach AVA map will have a unique imprimatur that comes from the individual artist, and while we have an overall cartographic theme, the art will transcend from one artist's brush to another, adding a variety of compositions and styles. We anticipate all artwork to be completed by January 2014.Leather items in the Series come in a choice of four colors reflecting the terroir and vineyard landscapes of rural Northern California wine country: natural (tan), sage, butter-gold, and lavender.Here's the Universe of our Limited Edition ""Wine Map Series"".Œæ Each Sonoma and Napa Appellation Wine Map Series is a limited edition and will be numbered and signed with a production number on a Series Certificate, which is included with each Series set or item.We'll be making 2,000 copies ofthe limited edition Coaster Map Series (1,000 of the LimitedEdition Sonoma Appellation Wine Map Series and 1,000 of Limited Edition Napa Appellation Wine Map Series); 3,000 copies of the individual Dinner Place Maps (approximately 1,000 with the SonomaAppellation Map, 1,000 with the Napa Appellation Map, and 1,000 with both Maps); 30,000 copies (total) of the 32 individual AVA Coaster Maps (approximately 1,000 for each AVA); 30,000 copies of the AVA Wine Glass Maps(approximately 1,000 for each AVA); 5,000 of the Appellation Wine Glass Maps (2,500 of the Sonoma Appellation Map and 2,500 of the Napa Appellation Map); 3,000 of the Lazy Susan Barrelhead Maps (approximately 1,000 with theŒæSonoma Appellation Map, 1,000 with the Napa Appellation Map, and 1,000 with both Maps), and: 2,000 of the Canine & Cat Maps 1,000 with the Sonoma Appellation Map and 1,000 with the Napa Appellation Map).Approximately 25% of the Limited Editions will be offered to the Kickstarter Backers as Rewards, some which will ship in time for the 2013 Holidays.The Digital Production Process.Œæ The laser produces beautiful and precise engravings,ideal for both artwork and maps. Afterdoing a number of laser projects, here's what you can anticipate from our production process.The maps and artwork for the appellations and AVAs are laser engraved onto the glasses, coasters, and place maps and, in the case of the leather items, they are vector cut by the laser into their square, oval or rectangular shapes.How we select the hides and oak. ŒæOur leather supplier has a cornucopia of hide selections andis located in Napa, California so I can personally inspect the materials firsthand. I'm looking for blemish-free hidesfor the best laser-ability. I examineand select each hide by hand. The oak barrel staves that form the coaster holders come fromquality used oak barrels from Sonoma and Napa county wineries. They are wine stained on one side, hand sanded and treated withvegetable oil to preserve the luster of the wood. I want the collections we create for you to be built to last, providing a lifetimeof use and memories. Digital Art Laser Engraving.Œæ Today's commercial laser engravers are the work-horse of most contemporaryŒæengravingbusinesses. They require minimalmaintenance and can operate non-stop, producing consistent, quality resultstime after time. The leather coasters, placemaps and marquees in the Series are ""raster"" engraved and""vector"" cut to precision, oftentimes in batches to reduce productionand laser time. Glasses are rasterengraved and produced one at a time.ŒæTo give you some insight to the production process, it takes about six minutes to laser engrave one of our appellation Wine Glass Maps, 30 minutes to laser one Barrelhead Map, 50 minutes to laser two Dinner Place Maps and 50 minutes to laser 24 Coaster Maps.The laser burns leather and wood when it engraves and cuts.ŒæGlass is actually fractured when engraved by the laser. All residue from the laser-cutting process is captured through a built-in exhaust system and a environmental protective debris bag. Laser cut leather leavesŒæsome charred carbon onthe edges of the coasters and place maps. We remove most of the carbon, but somemay remain. Overtime anduse, the carbon particles will dissipate from the edges. Whether you like the burnt look or wish itaway, all items will be cleaned, but the burned appearance will remain more orless. All items go through a finalquality inspection before being released for packing and shipment.Use of Pledges.Œæ I heard about Kickstarter online and learned about its novel funding approach for creative projects. My son talked to our neighbors who had successfully funded their ""camera-backpack project"" through Kickstarter. With this new avenue to fund the Series and with the positive support we received from family, friends and artists, we crafted this Kickstarter project submission.ŒæThe funds requested for our project will be used to create the complete Limited Edition Sonoma-Napa Appellations Wine Map Series (one for Sonoma Appellation and one of Napa Appellation) which will include: purchasing quality leather hides for the Coaster Maps and Dinner Place Maps, oak barrel staves and barrelheads, and wine glasses. We will also use the Kickstarter funds to pay commissions to the artists that render the artwork for the Series as well as production costs for the Rewards to our Backers (including Rewards for the Sonoma-Napa Series, the Coaster Map Set, the Dinner Place Map Set, the Wine Glass Map Set, and the Barrelhead Maps).ŒæOur Toast! ŒæWe believe our Sonoma-Napa Appellation Limited Editions will be attractive to wine lovers around the globe and hope you think so too! ŒæIf so, please help us reach our Kickstarter goal of $11,500 by pre-ordering the Rewards in our Limited Edition ""Wine Map Series"".ŒæAlong with our investments in this project, these funds will put us on the Map! ŒæAnd, your family and colleagues will love these unique Sonoma-Napa appellation maps as holiday, birthday, and anniversary gifts!Thank You!Œæ Thanks in advance for supporting our Campaign! ŒæPlease notice that four of the Limited Edition ""Wine Map Series"" Rewards will be shipped in time for the upcoming Holidays. Cheers!Packing and Shipping.Œæ Your items are packed and shipped to you via UPS or US mail. We carefully pack the items so that theyarrive to you without damage and we will replace any items that are damaged intransit.Product Materials and Dimensions.Œæ Thecoasters are 3.75"" x 3.75"" squares cut from 7 oz. to 8 oz. high-quality leatherhides: laser engraved and cut.

This preserves the collection and still serves its practical duty; the under-side actually absorbs very well and has a cool furry texture.ŒæLast Thing.Œæ Please note if you back a Kickstarter project, you will receive a ""Survey"" when the project is funded where you can select your options for your Rewards (Sonoma or Napa Series, Coaster and Place Maps, and Colors).Stay in Touch.Œæ Itäó»s optional, but after you back our project, you can send me an emailwith your name and choices and I can put you in the production queue.

1155," The VelociPrint Show 2013 is a collision of bicycle and art/design cultures.  Held inside Tucson's Borderlands Brewery in the heart of downtown, this event will be an evening full of bike folks, quality beer, exclusive yet affordable art, hanging with Tucson's established and emerging artists, and general bike/art revelry!At the heart of this show is a series of 15 print designs, each in an edition of 20, created by area artists.  Because the show is free to attend, and each print costs only $40, every show-goer can afford to take at least one print home, or even outfit an entire house or office.  It is our goal to ensure that everyone can afford at least one print, but still be able to pay the artists what they deserve for their hard work, so we must turn to Kickstarter backers to help with production costs. Each artist is responsible for creating his or her own print, so this Kickstarter Project is designed to help cover all the costs involved in producing the actual show itself. Borealis Arts, Zocalo Magazine, Borderlands Brewery, Tucson's Loop Bicycle Shop, and Cirrus Visual have all contributed to making this show happen, and you can join these local businesses in making this show a reality.  As you might imagine, the costs to produce, promote, and staff an event like this are rather large.  But, we're hell-bent on making this show happen, and with your help, we can prove that Tucson is a premiere bicycling and art community!"
1156," The project is to have a 2 week 'pop-up' shop, to give me a platform through which to introduce my greeting cards to the marketplace. The location of the shop is inside Priory Meadow Shopping Centre in Hastings, East Sussex, UK.The shop is in a prime position.The 'pop-up' shop is arranged through an organization called POP-UP BRITAIN. They arrange the rental of the shop for 2 weeks. Their objective is to utilize empty shop spaces. So it's a win-win situation!  And I would welcome the chance to have this retail opportunity.The funds for the shop project will be used in several ways including: printing stock of greeting cards, rent for the shop, PDQ portable card payment terminal, advertising including posters & business stationery and items for displaying my cards.I think my greeting cards would rank well amongst the competition in the greeting cards industry.

I have been producing art in my own style--what I like to call ""paper engravings"" or ""inkings""--for over ten years now. Around 2002, I began making prints of my art (they were decent quality for the time) to sell on Ebay and at craft fairs on Maui and in San Francisco. I also had a licensing deal with a line of fairy art. . .but the timing, my style--whatever--was not meant to be, and I had to stop activley producing my art and get a ""real"" job.

In the every month art you'll see our women at the ethnic ancient rituals that exist only in our culture and have mistic and sacral meaning.Why did we choose women as main theme? For a long time in our country a woman protected the hearthside and was at the height of family hierarchy. Ukrainian women have much more ancient genes than men and are considered aboriginal residents of our land.

1164," Hi there! My name is Victoria Gannon, although I am more commonly known as ""Leptailurus."" I'm a self-taught artist with big dreams and a love for animals.I've toyed with the idea of doing a tarot deck for almost a decade now. Eventually those idle thoughts turned into sketches, which turned into little paintings, which turned into the card designs you see here. I've always loved the imagery and meaning behind tarot and it only seemed appropriate to combine the symbolism with that of animals.With the Savage Divination tarotŒæI plan to explore the similarities between animals and human personality, drawing from myths, legends, folk lore, and general animal personality. For example, the ace of wands is perfectly represented by crafty Coyote, who stole fire from the spirits and gave it to man. The Empress is exemplified by the powerful lioness, determined mother and pride provider.I have completed a number of cards, which you can see a sampling of below, but there are dozens left to do. In addition to funding the printing of the decks, your pledges will let me dedicate my time to this project.This is a very large undertaking, but together we can achieve it!Hey folks! This is Lief again (the husband). Victoria is currently in the middle of a 17-day marathon at her day job, which is why there haven't been any updates or message replies in the past week. This project is her baby and for the most part it's best if the statements here are in her words, but I think this is an important enough milestone to warrant me stepping back in for a moment.I won't mince words. Right now, we're pessimistic about funding. Speaking in terms of dollars per day, we're at about a third of what we need... and to make it up, we'll need to average five times the daily pledge volume we've had so far. Now, this isn't impossible. Lots of projects pick up steam in the second half; and though pledges have been slow, they've been steady. Most importantly, it's clear that at this point we're not just floating on the initial rush of people who knew about this project beforehand: new people are finding it, and liking what they see. Because of that, I think there's still hope.The key is simple: we need to get more new people to find it. So, here's my plea: if you've already pledged, or even if you haven't but still want to support the project, tell everyone! Share the link. Tell your friends offline (for convenience, savagedivination.com redirects straight to the Kickstarter page). Ask them to tell their friends. Going straight-up viral would be nice, but really, all we need is a word-of-mouth campaign about five times stronger than what we've got. And let's face it: we came into this with no idea of how to manage a Kickstarter campaign, and we're still pretty much clueless. We've done a terrible job of marketing the project. So the way I see it, five times better is not a tall order!_The music in the project video is Divider by Chris Zabriskie, used under the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0."

1167," As a kid I used to read Mad Magazine and drool over the art created by the geniuses known as ""the usual gang of idiots."" Guys like Mort Drucker, Jack Davis, Paul Coker, Sergio Aragones, Al Jaffee, and the rest. After art school I was all geared up to make a name for myself in comics. I had a series of short comic stories published in a now-defunct comics anthology called Negative Burn, and I impressed the editor at Caliber Press at that time enough to offer me a one-shot comic book which was called Grumble.This was in the late nineties, and I found I had decided to get into the alternative comics field just in time for it to take a nose-dive in popularity. Even the biggest names in the industry were having a hard time making a living doing comics. Having to find work doing something else other than comics wasn't easy for me to do, but I had to eat. Fast forward many years... I've never lost my love of weird comics and artwork, and now sites like Facebook, Tumblr, and Instagram have provided artists like myself with a great arena for self-promotion, and sites like this one have made it possible for them to self-publish. This is something that just wasn't financially feasible in the past, so I think it's a great time for artists right now. Because that's what art is all about: the joy of creating and sharing it with other people, right?That's why I wanted to make this book. My hunger to draw and make comics is still alive and well, and has even increased over the past few years. I've been drawing tons of stuff and posting bits and pieces of it on various sites, but then most of it just goes into the closet to live with all my other filled up sketchbooks. So I wanted to take all of my favorite pieces from all of that and put them into one book and make it available to whomever might find it interesting.So that's what this is: A big book of my art. Complete pieces of art, not cropped or filtered, in full-color and all in one place. Now I just need a bit of help getting this thing printed, so I'm hoping other people are at least half as excited about it as I am.I'm not a drooling kid anymore, but the spark ignited by those Mad geniuses and my never-ending quest for the perfect line is stronger than ever. With your support, I'm hoping this book will be a proper tribute to those artists who paved the way for reckless dreamers like me. Thank you. Below are a few samples of some of the pages I've put together so far. Some of them have close-up detail view, just to give you a better idea of how it will look when it's printed."
1168," This is my second Kickstarter project proposing a book featuring 100 of my single panel cartoons. ŒæMy original idea was to work with a self-publishing company to produce a high quality book for distribution to bookstores: color cover, 'perfect' binding, quality interior paper, etc. ŒæThat project fell well short of its funding goal. ŒæThis time I am proposing a much more modest publication one which I can do myself at our local print shop and fold and staple. ŒæThis new proposal is not the fancy full color publication I had in mind, but even this scaled-down version is too expensive for my retirement budget. ŒæThe resulting publication will be similar to self-published (and self-assembled) books I have done in the past and, based on those experiences, the modest publication should do well in local and regional markets. ŒæI will load the books in the car and take them with me as I travel the West: photographing, fishing, hiking, and teaching. ŒæI am a traveling teaching artist and I drive all over the Four Corners Region of the Western U.S. teaching cartooning and illustration to children--kindergarten through eighth grades--in schools and libraries. ŒæI enjoy teaching and working with children because it provides me with a constantly changing perspective on my art and allows me to experiment with new techniques and formats. ŒæWho knows, as I distribute the less ambitious books envisioned in this project, a big investor or an existing publisher or a princess or a pixie with loads of cash and too much time on her hands might yet agree to fund a more elaborate full color second printing of Short Stories: 100 % Organic Cartoons.Œæ"
1169," The deck features impressionist-style oil paintings and research into the science and mythology for each sacred site, as well as an intuitive interpretation for the oracle.This will be the first of three Oracle of Gaia decks! Each deck will have 48 cards (for a total of 144 in this 3-part series) and an illustrated book. The collections are meant to be both teaching and mystical. The oracle aspect is meant to enliven your intuition and awaken your alignment with the earth (Gaia). The Oracle of Gaia is written and illustrated by Susan Tower.AnŒæOracleŒæis defined as 'a priest or priestess acting as a medium through whom advice or prophecy was sought from the gods in classical Greece'. The term has come to mean the voice of intuition or a story, sometimes coded, of the answer you seek.ŒæGaiaŒæis the Greek name for 'Goddess of the Earth'. In modern times, the term has expanded to a concept which considers the earth to be a living being. TheŒæOracle of GaiaŒæis like the 'Voice of the Earth'. Here, Her story is told through fact, mythology and intuition.The impressionist-style paintings of sacred sites of Gaia are meant to trigger your own remembering. The oracle deck can be used as a spiritual tool, much like a tarot deck, as easily as asking a question and drawing a card for an answer. This principle of divination is age-old and it works from the idea that All is in Divine Order, and the card you chose is the right one for this moment. Many ways to use the cards are suggested in the book.Sacred Sites are places on the earth that hold unseen energy vortexes that can help amplify and expand one's consciousness. Around the planet, hundreds of places are distinguished by large stone structures, stone circles or earthen mounds and are places of ancient spiritual ceremonies, often found where the earth's ley lines (energetic alignments between sites) meet or cross, or where the larger, earth-grid lines intersect. By their exact geomancy (auspicious placement), the sites expand the natural vibrational energy to a higher frequency and are like earth's 'hot spots'.ŒæAn understanding of Earth's natural energy grids can be a basis of spiritual practice and meditation.ŒæMythology indicates a vast, worldwide grid that was deactivated long ago to protect the planet from usurpers, and that now, with the rise in consciousness, the grid is being reactivated.ŒæThe way to benefit from the wisdom of the Oracle is to use it in your spiritual practice to strengthen the earth's energy-grid, as well as your own! This can be accomplished by working with the Oracle of Gaia cards to access these ancient and powerful energies.ŒæThere are many reasons. All are meant to trigger expansion and reconsideration of what we 'know'.ŒæThey provide empirical evidence of technologies we cannot explain; the precision with which these sites are placed on the planet is only now being discovered and the enormous stones used goes beyond our understanding of what is possible. Historically, this evidence belies what we have been taught about ancient people. Primitive cave dwellers or even slave-owning kings, could not have created these sites even with technology we have today. The proof of an advanced ancient culture will have to claim its place in our accounting of the past, and each piece of truth helps us know more about who we are. It is also valuable to know the mythologies around these sites, as the stories hold many hints as to what may have actually happened or how the sites were made. On more than one occasion, a myth taken seriously led to a significant archeological find such as the discovery of the ancient Greek city of Troy in the 1870's.ŒæStudying the treasure trove of tales is like planting seeds in your mind from the field of all possibilities.""The Oracle of Gaia deck is a profound collection of images for an oracle deck.ŒæEach of these cards evokes a sense of discovery.ŒæIt is a combination of energy lifting off each card, the beauty äóñ everything here is compelling, and the feeling of gravity äóñ in each scene there is a feeling of being at that place. Œæ""To embark on the invitation that these cards give is a gift to oneself, to go back into history, to draw on this spectacular human achievement of incredible mysteries and potential. Who knows how they did it? We still have a possibility to revive that potential, to engender a better world. That information is in our DNA memory. This is going to awaken people to their place in history.Œæ These paintings are so richly observed and rendered and I can taste that water and I can climb that tree, I can feel those birds flying. I can access a deeper part of myself."" ŒæŒæSteve MacDonald, professional psychic, Kansas City, MOSusan Tower is a professional illustrator and designer, with a long held a passion for both plein air painting (painting outdoors, on-site) and exploring ancient sites around the world. She combines the two whenever possible. The picture below shows her painting plein air at Machu Picchu, Peru.ŒæSusan has been to many of the places represented in this collection and has painted plein air whenever possible.Œæ""My spiritual direction and intention is to offer my paintings as a doorway for others to the activations and blessings of each location.""Susan grew up in Michigan and was invited to the Kansas City area to work at Hallmark Cards, Inc. when she graduated from college. She worked there as a designer for seven years and left to be a work-at-home mom when her daughter, Sierra was born. In 1990 she also began to work as an intuitive, doing spiritual art which she called 'Soul Paintings'. Over the years, she has done over a 1,000 of these intuitive readings. The feedback and popularity of this endeavor has given her the confidence and experience to include a thought-provoking intuitive voice for the Oracle of Gaia.""This project is a culmination of over 20 years of study and focus.

(Look for early bird prices).Below are a few samples of finished Oracle of Gaia cards, followed by a short summary of the location and meaning. 28 cards are done now, and 20 need to be painted to complete the set.ŒæMany types of ancient sites existŒæsuch as stone circles, mounds, labyrinths, navel sites, temples, oracle sites and pyramids.ŒæStonehenge äóñ Wiltshire, England ŒæŒæThe most famous of the megalithic sites, Stonehenge is also part of a larger network of sites and is well established to accurately track both lunar and solar time cycles. Not so well known, is that Stonehenge is aligned with several other significant sites through great circles and a world grid. The book will have maps and diagrams to illustrate these connections. As an oracle card, this would indicate a very central, very ancient spot within you, one that is aligned to other locations äóñ on the earth and in the cosmos.The Stone Rows of Carnac äóñ Carnac, France Œæ(below left)ŒæUnique in all the world, this site is on the western coast of France. These stone rows are part of a set of stone rows that go on for almost a mile, and when viewed from Google Earth, one can see elaborate structures and staircases underwater, just off shore. As an oracle, it indicates an alignment with sacred geometry and proper proportion as well as accessible, previously hidden knowledge just below the surface.Notre Dame Cathedral äóñ Paris, France Œæ(below right)ŒæA famous example of Gothic architecture, it is also an ancient Goddess location, as even now, its name reflects. Notre Dame means, 'Our Lady'; the site is now dedicated to the Virgin Mary. As an oracle, it indicates an alignment with the sacred feminine and its ancient roots in a matriarchal society.Chartres Cathedral, FranceŒæ Another magnificent example of Templar Gothic architecture, its art and carvings have long been examined for their esoteric symbology and hidden meanings. Deeper into history, this location was an ancient Goddess site and even today it is dedicated to the Virgin Mother and holds a remnant of cloth supposedly from Her, which has curiously survived several fires and destructive forces against the building throughout history. As an oracle, the labyrinth reminds us that the spiritual path in any journey goes back and forth as it meanders toward its completion. The cathedral itself represents hidden codes of sacred geometry and the perseverance of the feminine spirit, despite outer circumstance and persecution.Angor Wat äóñ CambodiaŒæŒæOriginally attributed to Hindus, it was later adopted for use by Buddhists. Measurements of lunar and solar time cycles can be found within its architecture that was overgrown with trees and vines. An unusual site, it is built with sacred geometric proportions, uses an unknown adhesive for the rocks, and notably, is oriented to the west (most sites are oriented to the east) and all rituals take place in reverse order. Experts postulate that this may have symbolized a funerary passage or the honoring of the Hindu God, Vishnu, who is associated with the west. As an oracle card, this location would indicate a reversal, a passage to another realm, perhaps seemingly not intended, and the benefits of meditation to transcend earthly issues."

1171," FOR MORE INFO: FACEBOOK.COM/COSPLAYCALENDARFLPROJECT DESCRIPTIONThe goal of this campaign is to fund The Cosplay Cosplay. Through Kickstarter, we hope to materialize this project and immortalize, through print, some of the sexiest and most talented cosplayers in Florida. We want to ensure that all our efforts and passion are successful and with your help, milestone a victory in the cosplay community.ABOUT THE COSPLAY CALENDARThe Cosplay Calendar began as an idea in July 2013. The concept involved uniting some of the sexiest and most talented cosplayers in the state of Florida and immortalizing them in a calendar. Initially, it was planned to have both male and female cosplayers, but due to the lack of submissions from male cosplayers, only female cosplayers were casted. All the photoshoots took place over a one month period throughout the South Florida area. Three of the photoshoots took place in the Orlando area where girls from Gainesville, Orlando, and Ft. Meyers participated. With a total of 12 enchanting photos, the 2014 Cosplay Calendar will surely make your year a very eventful one.WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?All the money raised through this campaign will go towards making the calendar happen! This includes production costs for calendar prints, copyrights, props, and other miscellaneous  expenses like gas and food.

We desperately need the help of the much supportive geek community on this! We canäó»t do it without you! All donations will have their reward and weäó»re sure the outcome will be one to be proud of.AN UNDERDOG STORYAs the project got closer to completion, we realized that a lot of our cosplayers were relatively new to the geek community. We embraced this. We want to ensure that this journey will be a successful underdog story, where the äóìless-popularäó costumers will feel proud about this project succeeding. We want to show the WORLD that those lesser known cosplayers CAN succeed in selling their image and are just as talented as the big names. Please help us ensure our underdog story is funded; from a group of äóìunderdogsäó ourselves, we thank you in advance!GET IT! ŒæFor only $25 you can purchase The Cosplay Calendar. Many cosplayers sell individual prints ranging from $10 to $20; The Cosplay Calendar includes 12 individual images and showcases 25 of Floridaäó»s sexiest and most talented female cosplayers. Also, all of our content is original and was shot by passionate äóìgeekestersäó who devoted a great amount of time to bring this project to light. So, youäó»re not only getting an amazing piece of work containing amazing artists, but youäó»d also be making a dream come true! Help us make this happen!REWARDS!Rewards include The Cosplay Calendar itself, have your name listed in the calendar, prints, digital copies of The Cosplay Calendar, t-shirts, and even sponsorships!

Yoga, when presented in a child's language,Œæcan help counter thestress experienced by young people living in a hurry-up world. We have created Yoga Flash Cards that are fun, teaches the alphabet, demonstratesthe pose, the name of the pose (in English) and we have added positiveaffirmations along with a character quality which supports the pose. How fun isthat?Now, what about Christians who are not comfortable with the""Sanskrit"" used in regular Yoga? Well..... we have that covered too! TheChristian approach to yoga simply allows us to combineŒætwo essentialgoals: Becoming physically healthyand spiritually healthy. We becomemore spiritually healthy through the yoga practice by calming our minds andquieting ourselves to the point that we can tune out the world's frequency andtune into God's frequency.ŒæŒæSo we have created Yoga Flash Cards forChristians. Instead of the positive affirmations, we have replaced it with asupportive scripture verse for that character quality! Way too cool!"
1174," The working title for this graphic novel is äóìCloudbustingäó, it is written and illustrated by Helen Dearnley BA (hons) Fine Art & Illustration University of Lincoln.The full synopsis and first pages are uploaded on this blogThe concept occurred in a dream after going to sleep reading Eric Drookeräó»s ""Flood"".ŒæEntirely conceived during the 2012 UK floods. The story is based on real events that occurred to the illustrator and single parent, graduating at the time of the 2008 recession, conflated with actual dreams, following on from previous research interests. It is a wordless graphic novel.ŒæThe starting point of the graphic novel begins with a dream in which the female protagonist was working with a male colleague. Re-appropriated imagery (ref: Cindy Sherman and Candice Breitz) from Kate Bush's Cloudbusting video depicts a female ""professor"" and a male colleague working together, heaving a large, heavy, covered object up a hill. They appear as small silhouettes.ŒæThe characters in Kate Bushäó»s original video have been re-appropriated to place the female protagonist as the äóìProfessoräó, and her male colleague working together. This is because the story is being told from a female perspective. The pair are torn apart from each other at the point after the government come to destroy the research at the end of Kate Bushäó»s video. The style of the illustrations at this point change specifically with reference made to Andrzej Klimowskiäó»s The Depository; the female protagonist finds herself trapped in a vitrine in The Depository. The storyline then conflates numerous sources, including Florence And The Machineäó»s ""Cosmic Love"" and Lowelläó»s ""The Birds"", blackbirds in place of the book angels fly across the city skyline to communicate in dreams.ŒæThe female heroine's adventures through grief, homelessness, false accusations, and DWP jobkill depict scenarios that Eric Drooker knows all too well, and eventual reunion with the male protagonist lead to a very different ending, and located in a different city. Although illustrated from a female perspective, this aims to be read by a broad readership, to share challenges faced by single parents so that others may learn from those experiences. It follows a similar narrative as Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"", but it isn't meant to appeal only to women.ŒæAnne Elliott said ""Men have every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.""ŒæThe aim is for this to be completed and published - I will require a publisher that perhaps specialises in graphic novels, and it's of interest to Eric Drooker himself when it's completed.Cloudbusting Flood remix by Helen AThe music for the video samples Pxl's remix of Kate Bush's original Cloudbusting song, edited with vocals courtesy of Apparatjik and ""Everybody Is One Bar"". Vocals by Jonas Bjerre and Guy Berryman. Original Cloudbusting music and video remain the intellectual property of Kate Bush.ŒæAbout the production costsŒæThis Kickstarter pitch aims to raise some of the costs of producing the graphic novel. As a considerable amount has been illustrated already, the goal is set low in the hope to raise more, and / or follow this up with another funding pitch. The full costs of labour would be impossible to raise via Kickstarter in one month alone.All funding covers labour, printing / publishing costs, shipping and Kickstarter fees. If funding goes over the limit, further additional rewards will be added in, such as Dearnley's Tea-O-Meter etc.ŒæAbout the authorŒæHelen Dearnley aka ""Blackbird"" is an artist and illustrator based in Lincoln, UK.Her first self-published comic ""The Unreal God And Aspects Of His Non-Existent Universe"" documented real and imaginary adventures with iconic comic book band A-ha.Œæ""I want one!

Her Nobel Peace Centre wish came true a couple of months later in Sheffield, where Helen met Morten Harket, and gave him one of the original copies of the comic as a retirement present.

I have set a low budget to raise some costs to cover overheads, but this is only a proportion of the full costs, considering how much work goes into producing a graphic novel. As such, the amount I'm raising for this month is only the first installment. From April 2014 there is also the very real risk of being forced into government workfare programmes. Of course, I have no intention of becoming homeless, or the government trying to destroy my research!I've applied for the AA2A scheme this year, so that I can access and use facilities at University, especially the mac suite in Illustration, and the print room. The use of the print room will enable me to create mini zines and prints, perhaps to sell to support the project and raise more funds. However, I won't know if I'm successful with this until October. Once the project is funded, I may require further support, and I will still need to finish it. I've illustrated approximately 50 pages already, which I estimate to be about half the book, but I don't expect to finish it within a year. I'm allowing 2-3 years for this to be completed. An estimated completion date is offered of 2016. Of course, I'm aware that finding a publisher isn't going to be easy, and I expect to send my manuscript to as many as possible in the hope that it will be published. Once it's published, the real fun will begin!"
1175," What I want to create is an exciting softcover book filled with 70 pages of illustrated stories about how human life began. It will be an interesting and educational read with beautiful sequential illustrations exploring each story.The book will contain a diverse collection of stories from many different religions (Christianity, Hinduism, Shintoism, Scientology, etc), scientific research (Evolution, Panspermia) and ancient civilizations (Babylonian). It will explore these legendary stories through visualization, allowing comparison and exploration.It'll be a limited edition, first run and each backer will have their name included in the Thank You section in the finished product.This book is important as I donäó»t believe all of these legendary stories have been collected into such an accessible and enjoyable format like this before. I'm asking for your help to make it happen, to get this book printed and out into the world.This book does not parody any religious beliefs, it portrays everything with a completely neutral view, with the intent of allowing the reader to decide which story they want to believe, if any at all. After months of investigation I narrowed my research down to 15 stories that I think are the most important, entertaining and visually exciting. I then began the process of converting these stories into illustrations, a massive task this is almost complete. Right now I am currently putting the book together and doing some preliminary printing planning.It looks like this project will go immediately to print if I reach my goal. If by some crazy chance I exceed my goal I intend to upgrade the book, possibly to a hardcover, higher quality printing techniques and maybe even take an extra week to illustrate a few more stories that didnäó»t make the cut.I have tried to make sure every donation is rewarded, either with a digital copy, a physical copy or a mounted print of one theory.Below are some images of the proposed final book:Reward 1:Reward 2:Reward 3:"

Our intention is to create a map that gives an historic look at the 54 miles between Selma and Montgomery Alabama, in 1965, when African Americans fought for the freedom to vote.The voting rights movement in Selma started when local African-Americans formed the Dallas County Voters League. The addition of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee created an assertive alliance. In 1963, the coalition initiated voter-registration efforts but progress was slowed by the attempts of others to limit the creation of an inclusive voting system. A march to the Alabama Capital was planned to gain more support for their effort.On March 7, 1965, ""Bloody Sunday"" unfolded before the nation, and attention was drawn to Selma and the plight of many as they fought to exercise their right to vote.Œæ Two days later, when Martin Luther King, Jr. joined the marchers they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a symbolic effort to gain protection from state and federal law enforcement.By March 21, 1965, about 3,200 marchers set out on historic U.S. Route 80 on the way to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama. This was the 3rd and most successful attempt. Walking 10-12 miles a day, they slept at farms or in fields as momentum started to grow. The world was now watching closely as they--now 25,000 strong reached the Alabama State Capitol building on March 25, 1965Ideas come first. In June, 2012 we started to create maps with our new business, Historic Maps. The first maps were of locations we knew well and visited many times. We joined the National Registry of Historic Places and began to do more research. We came across the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights Trail and decided this would make a great map. We adopted it as our new challenge. The historic ""Voting Rights Trail"" fit the model for our map creations: An iconic road or highway that contains buildings or structures that offer an artistic attraction to be presented in a illustrated map.ŒæIn February of 2013, we visited Alabama and traveled U. S. Route 80 from Selma to Montgomery. We walked on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We visited the museums, markers, churches, state buildings, monuments and farms. We took pictures and recorded GPS locations.Œæ We have made contact with several historians. One in particular, Joanne Bland of Selma, was present at the Edmund Pettus Bridge on ""Bloody Sunday"" in 1965 and knows first hand what went on the day. She has been and will continue to be a source of information and verification of accurate content.Œæ ŒæŒæŒæŒæAn historical rendering of the road, bridges, buildings and other iconic features is the key to our effort when remembering what happened in 1965. We have pictures and words. We have maps of roads and labels. All are parts of history.An illustrated map of original art will give us another opportunity to share the ""big picture"" to those you want to understand what happened in 1965. It is not only a piece to hang on the wall and remember but is to also an opportunity to share the story and educate the young. We need to remember and not repeat the examples of an exclusive society.This map will take $5,600 to launch by December of 2013.We need to...After developing four maps in 2013, we have used up our original investment capital. We currently have four maps for sale. Although launch and initial reaction have gone well, sales continue to be slow. Consistent but slow. ""54 miles for the right to vote"" may become our best selling map but launching it will only come from an infusion of new investment capital. After using our original investment from a retirement account, we no longer intend to borrow more money, taking on additional debt. Our business will survive by becoming self-financed from this point onward. "
1180," WHAT IS A PANTONE'D PORTRAIT?Pantone'd portraits are created from individual colour swatches. Each piece of art is created from 1,600 individual colour swatches. Every swatch is the average colour hue of that particular square section of the image.Zoomed in, the art is just a series of abstract block swatch colours. Only when you step back or squint do you actually see the full image in all its glory and detail.I am hoping to gain funding to have the opportunity to create custom, high quality Pantone'd prints from your favourite photographs. My prints are not just a great wall art, they're also a great gift for anyone who is into art, design, interiors or anything else creative. HOW DID YOU GET THE IDEA?Bizarrely the idea for Pantone'd portraits evolved from my passion of gaming, specifically retro gaming. I was creating some simple retro pixel art images for my wall and required somethingŒæ I could use for my pixels. With my design background, colour swatches seemed like the perfect solution. The whole thing snowballed from there. I then created a series of comic book swatch art and then some based on starwars characters.... and now here I am.WHAT IS A PANTONE COLOUR SWATCH ANYWAY?The Pantone solid colour system has over 1100 individually named and numbered colours. The Pantone matching system was devised for the graphics, printing and publishing industries as a way of specifying and controlling colours for print output. WHO DOES THE ARTIST THINK HE IS?That's me in the main banner. I'm just a humble, creative type from Newcastle who loves art, design and beautiful colourful things. I have always created, but never had the confidence to promote anything I have done. It's only in the last year or so that I have revealed anything I have made to be viewed. Check out my blog page for more info about me, my history, and to see some of the stuff i've been up to:http://frigopie76.wordpress.com/Creating colour swatch art is massively rewarding. Taking a photo and converting it into simple colour swatch art is time consuming, fun... and the end result, to me, is almost always beautiful......... even Newcastle :)OK, CUT TO THE CHASE! WHAT REWARDS WILL I GET?This has been ridiculously difficult to decide upon. I wanted everyone who funded me to get something of value (Not just a basic boring thankyou).If succesfully funded, everyone who pledges Œ£5 or more will recieve a 40+ page pdf digi book of my pantone'd works and a few more interesting works by myself. Also everyone who funds me will be mentioned and thanked in the pdf book and on my web blog. The Pdf digibook will be of high quality ... but won't be print quality at large sizes.For funding of Œ£10 or more you will be sent signed artist prints. Printed onto paper, canvas or acrylic each one will be checked and signed by myself. Every piece will be unique.Fund Œ£30 or more and I will personally create your own piece of pantone'd art from any photo of your choice.See rewards for details.... and below for product descriptions.- Paper giclee art prints are printed onto photographic grade 250gsm paper. All paper prints are coated for durability and sent out securely rolled up. - Canvas giclee art prints are stretched onto 38mm deep gallery frames. (Printed with a matte finish.) - High end acrylic prints are beautiful and vibrant. The crystal clear 5mm thick diamond polished acryic sits 25mm from the wall attached with 4 stainless steel fixings. All prints signed by myself and marked to show that they are original limited edition of 1 single unique print. If I ever get famous, they could be worth thousands.... you never know.I can create your Pantone'd art in 2 options (See image above):1. Adobe Illustrator Pantone Swatch colour picker style.2. Traditional Pantone'd swatch art with customised name.Note - Smaller prints can only be created in illustrator style swatches as text on the traditional style is just too small and illegible. Unfortunately I cannot deliver larger prints outside of the UK. (The costs for shipping art overseas are crazy expensive.) If money is not an issue, send me a message and I will find out shipping costs for you or sort something.I'VE PAID MY MONEY, WHERE'S MY ART?My Goal is for just Œ£1,500 of backing but I calculate I could cope with upwards of Œ£7,500 (May be some delay if more than that.)If there are any delays, all affected parties will be informed as soon as is humanly possible. My Goal is for just Œ£1,500 of backing but I calculate I could cope with upwards of Œ£7,500 (May be some delay if more than that.) If I raise my goal target, (once I recover from the elation), I will contact everyone who donated and give details on what to do next. Most likely I will email an order form so I can get full details and keep everything organised. I will also, need to be emailed a photo so I can create your art.I will work through my rewards in the order in which people pledged. The sooner you pledge... the quicker you will get your reward.SHOW ME SOME PANTONE'D EXAMPLES!OK Here you go!WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU GET FUNDED?Hopefully I will raise funds to be able to create and complete this project and spread the colourful joy of Pantone'd art. Any funds remaining after fulfillment may just allow me to produce a few extra art prints. I hope to display these in local galleries, coffee shops, bars etc.My long term goal is to break free from the day to day grind and produce my art projects full time. Not an easy task but you have to start your dreaming somewhere. Please help me fund this project. There's no reason not to. (If there is, let me know). The art is top quality, the concept is stunning and the rewards are amazing.All my art is created digitally - No original Colour swatches will be harmed in the making of this project.Any questions? - pantoned@monowaveart.co.uk"

1182," I'm Mark and I need your help making this teaching poster come to life!My idea for äóÖThe Elephant Lessonäó» springs from reading 19thcentury American poet John Saxeäó»s re-tellingof the Indian parable ""The Blind men and the Elephantäó. As the story goes,a group of blind men never having seen an elephant, touch it to learn what itäó»slike. Each one feels a different part such as the tail, trunk or tusk. Aftercomparing their findings, they discover they are in complete disagreement andstart to argue. One man thinks itäó»s a snake, another a tree and then anotherman a brush; each man steadfastly sure what he thinks is truth. After much debate, the blind menstop arguing, start listening and collaborate to ""see"" the fullelephant. The moral is while one's experience is subjectively true, it may notalways be correct.I instantly recognized this poem's value in helping my 7 year old understand the necessity of listening to ideas from his friends, his teachers and even his parents. The message takes a little bit longer to get through to adults but they're fair game as well.For short attention spans,Iäó»ve abbreviated and modernized Saxeäó»s prose along with creating a unique elephant character to engage young learners. I've chosen Century Gothic as the typeface after learning it's recommended by the British Dyslexia Association as a dyslexia-friendly font.I've made 3 versions for different tastes and audiences. Each option below will be available as your choice for reward. All prints will be finished on 13"" x 19"" Premium Matte with border for framing. Not too big, not too small, just right.Hung up in the home, office orclassroom, äóÖThe Elephant Lessonäó» serves dual purpose as a delightful work ofart and an invitation to discuss the value of peacefuldiscourse and shared perspective. "
1183," Weäó»ve been collecting prints of various sizes of Troll Shaman, as well as many others, so that we can distribute them throughout numerous galleries, and for a planned sketchbook of some of Michaeläó»s similarly-themed art, coming soon! Michael is in a rare category of artists, whose work with fine line and form is so precise, it can be enlarged to any size, while most artistsäó» work deteriorates after enlarging. Michael sketches with black and white, pen & ink, using exquisite detail to bring his works to life, using faces of everyday street people, family, or friends as models, and then adding his own fantasy twist so that the life in Troll Shamanäó»s eyes can be unmistakably felt by the viewer.Hereäó»s Michaeläó»s own description of his process with äóìTroll Shaman:äó -äóìThe initial seed of the idea was planted when more and more of my friends were getting these large ""ear gauges"" or ""plugs,"" and I thought that they looked so exotic and visually striking, and simply stored it in my brain for future use. After deciding to incorporate this, and sprinkling in some other trinkets, I thought that the initial stages of ""Troll Shaman"" had a cool indigenous feel to him, like he existed in the wild somewhere, but he hadnäó»t come to life yet, not really. He needed an especially visually striking element, something that set him apart from everything else, and I did not know what that was at the time. So again, I shelved him for further fermentation, and did some sketching on him from time to time, but always felt like I struck out. Eventually I had a breakthrough with an idea to elongate his head and pull it upwards, so that he had this striking element on the top of his head, but something natural: Hence, the horns protruding straight from the top of his skull. And after that, the big bully drew himself with my hands. My final copy of ""Troll Shaman"" began with the eyes as the first thing I drew, because I knew that the whole piece would hinge on whether one could feel the vitality emanating from him. He needed to look like heäó»d experienced fantasies and horrors akin to living a long life in HIS world, he needed to look world-warn from HIS environment, and with primitive ornaments and decorations dangling from him. After that, it was a simple matter of refining the sketch, and tightening things up. Every piece of art has 2 stages, planning and execution. The planning was complete, now was actually the easier stage of the two, now it was time to focus on the technical aspects of physically rendering a subject. Usually this I do on autopilot. A night or two and he was done, one of my most iconic and powerful characters. The Troll Shaman."" Œæ-Michael Scott Fairchild"
1184," It all started while I was volunteering at a local animal shelter. ŒæThey had recently acquired a tiny black and white feral kitten, and he wasn't coming around socially. Of course, I immediately fell in love and knew I had to foster him to prevent his otherwise untimely death.

In short, he has inspired this campaign.I want to create an illustrated ebook full of adoption and rescue stories using Lulu.com. ŒæI already have collected several stories for the book, but I want to include more. I want to tell as many stories as possible, and I want them to be yourŒæstories. I know you have them.

1189, Sexual assault and abuse impact people in deeply profound ways.

Your answers help build the world.Sneaky peeks at work in progress artwork etc.And any other exciting news.If you donate over Œ£100 you will be sent this very special care package which includes:An A3 Poster of 'Day of Reckoning- Regigigas Awakens' (SubjectŒæto change)A selection of Pokemon themed badges:A Pokemon Academy graduationŒæcertificate:A Pokemon Academy Bookmark:Acceptance letter to the Pokemon League:If we receive the full amount of funding (or more) we will move forward as a team, getting the information ready for the first release.ŒæWithin a year of receiving the funding we will have a screening of the website to which only the 'Beta Testers' will all be allowed to see. We will have a message board open for one week where you can state your likes and dislikes about the site.ŒæWe will then go away and fix any bugs and change anything that you guys didn't like.ŒæThe site will then launch to the general public with the first lot of content. This will probably include a large amount of Pokemon, a detailed look at Pallet and much much more.Finally we will begin to give monthly updates with new and exciting things like new Pokemon, Gyms, Tech etc Also possible videos with presenters giving you all the latest news on everything Pokemon (if budget allows).We will work on a region at a time, very much how you work your way through the games but including information from every source, up until the latest release. This means you will get content out faster and you will be constantly updated with new and exciting things!Eventually I want to be able to invite artists and writers from all over the world toŒæcontributeŒæand offer areas for fans to post fan art and fan fiction. I also have ideas in the far future to involve 3D artists from around the world to create a 'National Geographic' style web series, but this can only be done with backing and community support.So in conclusion without your help and support to fund this ambitious, but exciting project, it will never happen. It is in no interest of Pokemon to do this as they make so much money on the current franchise.So lets take it into our own hands and prove to the world that Pokemon still holds a flame in the hearts of those who grew up with it.Please, help me turn this dream into a reality.Thank you,Joshua Dunlop"
1192," I plan to create three coloring books, two of which have sprung into being while I was trying out Kickstarter for the first time with Dance of the Unicorns.Dance of the UnicornsOnce upon a time, a little girl had a dream. She dreamed she could dance with unicorns. As time went on, she realized that this would be a difficult thing to do, unless she could create the unicorns herself.Putting her imagination to work, she began creating a story about meeting a unicorn prince. She refined the idea for many years, growing up and learning how to illustrate along the way. She never forgot that story.The time has come to share this tale, and share the images that have grown along with it. The images are still being created in the modern style of its creator.Fanci CatsCats are beloved world-wide, and the cuter the cats the more loved they become. The Fanci Cats of Cat Osborne's imagination are cute, indeed.The images in this publication are based on the Fanci Cats series of ACEO cards produced by the artist. With over 100 Fanci Cats decorating art cards in the first year of their creation, they have been loved by people of all ages around the world.Horse Breeds from Around the WorldHorses are a beloved part of man's history and appear in nearly every culture around the world. Through selective breeding for specific traits, out landscape is decorated with many breeds of horses, in all colors and sizes.Given the artist's love for equines, it is only fitting that this animal be among the first of her coloring books.A coloring book is a timeless, innocent entertainment, allowing children and adults alike to express themselves. It is the artist's hope that it is also the perfect way to share her childhood dream to be part of the Dance of the Unicorns.This Kickstarter project is to produce three coloring books in both PDF and print formats. Each book is slated to contain 24 plates. Sadly, there is no video equipment available to the artist at this time, but she's working on it to be better able to share with you all."

1196," ""Experiencing The Divine Comedyäó - a ten (10) year project - retells Danteäó»s story as a graphic novel and fantasy art collection. It not only promises a more vivid and more comprehensive retelling than ever before, it promises to take its viewers along a terrifying trip through hell, a fiery tour through purgatory, and a hypnotically beautiful journey through heaven. In this version of Dante Alighieriäó»s story, the readers experience the horrific and beauteous sights as they were described almost 700 years ago.ŒæThe reasons are simple.Œæ1. To date, The Divine Comedy has been fully illustrated by only a handful of well-known artists --  partially illustrated by a little over a dozen. This project will illustrate the entire book.Œæ2. This project will also illustrate everything in the book as described, and more. Dante once wrote in a letter to Cangrande, Danteäó»s host during his exile from Florence, ""äó_ at the beginning the subject matter is horrible and frightening because it deals with Hell, at the end happy desirable and pleasant because it deals with Paradise. And the style is low and humble, because it is written in the vulgar language, which is the language used [by all] including women of humble conditions"" (xiii, 31).ŒæJust as Dante wanted everyone to understand and appreciate his story, this promises to spare nothing, and portray Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven in their vulgar glory.I first discovered The Divine Comedy in my plight to understand angels. My first experience with angels was in 1990-1991 äóñ and to make a long story short, I was pretty convinced that I actually saw the things. But I still wanted to know if I had a simple hallucination or if I had a real experience. And it was through a spirituality catalog that I found a description of Danteäó»s book. So I borrowed the book from my local library to see if what I experienced was described somewhere (anywhere), and in the process of reading it, I fell in love with the story, and decided to illustrate its entirety.Fast forward 10 years or so and a portfolio full of angels later... I stopped drawing around 2005 due to a premature death of a close family member (and a consequential long battle with depression). It wasnäó»t until about 7 years later, or, as Dante would say, äóìIn the Midway upon the journey of our life...äó did I pick up a pencil and pad of paper after my teens challenged me to start drawing again. This was my response to that challenge äóñ a drawing derived from Gustave Doreäó»s Death angel. Gustave not only played a huge role in my love for drawing, he illustrated Danteäó»s Divine Comedy, and upon re-discovering his artwork, my yearning for drawing the story returned. The Divine Comedy is divided into three major parts: Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Each part is divided into 33 cantos, or chapters. My intention is to illustrate each canto with its own scene, making the entire project a collection of about 99 scenes (approximately 33 scenes per part). ŒæTo date, I've completed 31 rough sketches of the 1st part of the book (Hell).ŒæAt this point, the project has literally just begun with the bookäó»s 1st illustration. And due to the amount of detail I put into each drawing, it takes me about a month to complete just one illustration, placing this projectäó»s completion date somewhere around 9 years, or, 3 years per part (Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven).There are a few reasons why this project is so important and why it needs your support.ŒæFirst, the story on its own is a timeless masterpiece that makes this project worth the time, money, and effort. It provides a hard-core and sometimes frightening insight into man's own acceptance of what he cannot change (Hell), what he can change (Purgatory), and ultimately, what he could own (Heaven). The entire experience is a vivid adventure of valuable life lessons that beg for visual depiction.ŒæSecond, Iäó»m most certain that illustrating this book on such a grand and graphic scale will generate a deserved re-interest in not only Danteäó»s work, but more importantly, the bookäó»s meaning(s). Reworking the story in a pure, visual manner, and then sharing the results with a generation that might not know this classic poem will help grow and preserve Danteäó»s audience for years to come.ŒæThird, this project makes Danteäó»s story, the vieweräó»s story. Past illustrations of Danteäó»s book almost always portray images of Dante and his guide, Virgil, in every scene. In this project, these two characters are completely removed to emphasize the storyäó»s horrific and beautiful environments along with their events. In doing this, the viewer becomes a visual participant of the story, rather than a simple observer of Danteäó»s story, and ultimately travels along a series of thought processes destined to enlighten judgement of oneäó»s own self and life. Without sufficient support, the project may not be completed. And even if by some miracle it is completed without that support, it wouldn't be finished in the time frame required to circulate within the right circles, generate the right interest, and ultimately, communicate with the right audience. That requires funding for materials, labor, and promotion that I simply donäó»t have at the moment.Funding will pay for art supplies, labor, and advertising over a span of 10 years. It will also pay for web hosting appropriately fitted to provide the projectäó»s video, picture, and textual documentary. For more info, please see this project's FAQ."
1197," Hello, my name is Alex Wakefield and I am a fine artist out of Joliet, IL. My passion and inspiration for my work has been so directly linked with motorsports that it's hard to know which started first. Did my love for fast moving machinery inspire me to create, or did my love for drawing and painting inspire me to make art based on motorsports? Either way, this is what I love, and I hope to make it a larger part of my career. With your help, this is where my Kickstarter campaign can make that a possibility. After a successful show at the Chicago D|Store, I have been invited by the two California D|Stores to show my work in a touring exhibition this August.At each D|Store location, the art exhibit will coincide with that weekends televised MotoGP race. The exhibit dates are as follows: D|Store Orange County - August 16-18 Indianapolis MotoGP D|Store San Francisco - August 23-25 Czech MotoGPŒæ It is up to me to come up with the funding to get me and my art to these locations.I will produce 15 works of art. They will consist of both paintings and illustrated pieces. I have already completed 7 pieces, more than half of the work to achieve this goal, and I will continue to work diligently.I know I have the ability and tenacity to reach my goal. The biggest obstacle will be the financial. The cost of materials, meaning everything from paint and canvas to scanning and print creation, as well as the support costs, such as living expenses and transportation for myself and my work, is going to amount to $5000. Your contribution can help make my goal a reality.I have spent the last year taking the needed steps to build notoriety for my work.

1200," Greetings And Quick Back StoryHello and thanks for checking out this Kickstarter Campaign for the launch of Vlad's Undead Angels 2014 calendar, holiday cards, posters, stickers, and T-shirts.My name is Jeff Mason and I came up with a line of products centering around great artwork, by myself and/or commissioned for me from great artists I am working with to specifications from my ideas. These designs center around vampires, zombies and other monsters. I want to represent good quality products, that are well detailed, sexy and/or graphically eerie, depending on the main subject. I am releasing these designs under the banner of Enforcer Designs. The name Enforcer Designs is derived from my drumming stage name, Vlad The Enforcer, which led to my services company name Enforcer Webdesign, Video, & Graphics LLC, and ultimately to Enforcer Designs.While working with different artists for Enforcer Designs a style was developed that has became a subdivision called Vlad's Undead Angels. Imagine very attractive zombie girls dressed in different outfits that common fantasies arise from and drawn in a manga/anime style, and you have Vlad's Undead Angels.I actually have the base drawings ofŒæ more than 15 designs, as well as a bunch in my head that I can't wait to bring to life. I then realized as I started to research, that I didn't have the capitol to go to print. I originally thought for the shirts I could go with the type sites that you put the shirt on and if someone bought it they print it and you get a (very) small cut. But when I ordered a few ""prototypes"" for myself the images were so small on the shirt I felt the designs were not given justice.I started researching and started crunching numbers on what I would need to order as a minimum to make it worth while to go to print with each design, in each print format, while still keeping the numbers low enough for a feasible and obtainable goal. Obviously the more you order the less expensive the products get to print.Vlad's Undead Angels 2014 CalendarI always wanted to do an artistic calendar, and once Vlad's Undead Angels were born I realised they would be the perfect theme for one. There are currently 6 Undead Angels already drawn for upcoming shirts and posters, which I figured would be the starting point for the calender, but as I started researching and planning what would be the featured Undead Angel each month, I decided that we should draw almost entirely new drawings centering more around the months they will be representing. So in the video and images you will see the current finished Undead Angels, and rest assured all Undead Angels in production will look just as good! 6 of the months are currently already in early production, and should be able to at least give you an idea of the main subjects by the end of the campaign. Backgrounds will be added later.That brings us to the costs associated with making a calender. I need to pay the other artists helping out with the project, and the printing costs. This is where the biggest chunk of the money will go as the place I currently am looking to go with will be charging me just over $3000 for the printing and delivery of the calenders. While I could have set this Kickstarter a little lower and just launched the calenders, I figured thereŒæisn'tŒæmuch in the way of Rewards if I only do the calender. So I decided to offer Stickers of each months Undead Angel, and also Christmas, Halloween, Valentines Day, and Birthday cards. All the card and postcard printing, while adding more diversity in rewards, adds another $2056 in printing costs.ŒæSo by going through the costs I pretty much also went through the rewards. The calendars, postcards, and greeting cards, but I also would like to add something limited edition that will only be available for the duration of the Kickstarter campaign. So I am offering 12x12 Stretched Canvas Prints Wrapped on Thick 1.5"" Wood Frame, with Protective, Satin Finish Coating of each calender girl. There will be a limit of only 30 per design/month, and once this campaign ends, no matter how many were sold over 0 they will never be offered again. (If none sell at all, I reserve the right to offer it again, if one sells, then that's all there will ever be.)A quick rundown of what I am planning for each month. January, I could have went with New Years, but what costume really signifies that? I decided to use the only currently drawn Undead Angel that will be used in the calendar, which was also the very first one drawn. Kind of a new beginning to represent January. Drum roll.... that being the Cheerleader. ŒæI thought of her for February as that's when the Superbowl is played, but I had another idea for February.February will be an Undead Angel dressed as Cupid for Valentines Day.March will be an Undead Angel in a bunny costume for Easter.April will be an Undead Angel as a Secretary, or to be politically correct, Administrative Assistant for Secretary's Day / Administrative Assistant's Day.May will be an Undead Angel as a Teacher for National Teachers Day.June will most likely be a Graduating Undead Angel as Graduations normally take place in June.July will represent Independence Day / 4th Of July with an Undead Angel wearing Red, White, and Blue and an Uncle Sam style top hat.August will be a Lifeguard Undead Angel representing summer since I didn't see much holiday wise going on in August. I mean what am I gonna do to demonstrate August 13, Left Hander's Day???September will be a School Girl Undead Angel to represent the beginning of the school year.October will represent Halloween with a Undead Angel dressed for Halloween. I really would like to have her dressed as a known Super Hero, but think that would be a copy write issue, so most likely she will be dressed as a devil. Lets face it what other opportunity would you have to see an attractive zombie devil anyway?November will be a Native American Undead Angel, most likely feasting on a Pilgrim, to represent Thanksgiving.December will obviously represent Christmas with an Undead Angel either as a Santa's Helper, or as Mrs. Claus herself, nibbling on Santa. ""I Won't Bite"" & ""You Have The Right"" T-Shirts Posters & StickersI am very excited about the first two shirts in the Undead Angels line, ""I Won't Bite"" and ""You Have The Right"".Œæ ""I Won't Bite""Œæ features the only Vamp Undead Angel so far, but if well received expect to see more! ""You Have The Right"" features the first Zombie Undead Angel that is ready to go right to print!The money you pledge will go towards the mass printing of probably about 50 shirts, 500 posters and 500Œæ 4""x6"" stickers of each ""I Won't Bite"" and ""You Have The Right"", and any custom printed canvas' ordered. The money will also go towards packing materials;Œæ cardboard rolls for the posters and bags for the shirts. These too cost money and had to be factored in to what I need. Aside from that the actual shipping costs. Side note even if ordering a shirt and a poster they will be shipped separate to protect the poster.ŒæI am making 4 shirt styles available; men's/unisex t-shirt, woman's jersey, men's long sleeve, and woman's long sleeve. The posters will be 18"" x 24"" 100lb Paper Glossy Poster. And lastly the special reward that will never be offered again. A numbered 18"" X 24"" Canvas Print Limited to NO MORE than 100.This limited edition offer is only going to be available during this Kick Starter Campaign, and limited to the number sold during this Kick Starter campaign, and not to exceed 100. So if 5 sell they will say 1/5 through 5/5 respectively on the side or back. If 1 sells then you will be the sole owner of 1/1. Ect.This is the only time this will be offered, so it is very limited and special.I have made most rewards available to be shipped outside the USA as well. Not only is worldwide recognition good, but some of my artists are also out of country. I hope the out of country shipping fees are reasonable to us both as these things are hard to figure. Stretch Goals & Unlockable Rewards!As I already mentioned, I have many designs ready to go that I cannot afford to print. And I have more designs planned which I can't go forward with until I get the others printed. So I have compiled the remaining Vlad's Undead Angels that are currently complete into some Stretch Goals. I hope to get to them but if not now, then later and hopefully we were at least able to get the calendar made.Stretch Goal #1 äóñ Vlad's Undead Angels Street Sign Shirt Shirts (40), Stickers (1000) - $11,000Stretch Goal #2 äóñ Horror Doll Womens Shirts (40), Stickers (1000) - $12,000Stretch Goal #3 äóñ Postcards of the 12 Calender Designs, ""I Won't Bite"", ""You Have The Right"", & ""Horror Doll"" (1000 Each)Œæ - $13,000Stretch Goal #4 äóñ Cowgirl & Nurse Shirts, Stickers, Post Cards, & Posters - $16,000Stretch Goal #5 - $18,000 äóñ Zombie Twins Shirts, Stickers, Post Cards & Posters - $18,000Stretch Goal #6 äóñ 12 Calender Girl Shirt Designs (40 Each) Black Male or Ladies T-Shirts - $24,000Stretch Goal #7 - Remaining 8 Completed Enforcer Designs Shirts & Stickers: ""Witches Gathering"", ""Vamps Feed"", ""Zombie Girls UnEarth"", ""Drunken Pirate Captain"", ""Skeletal Guitarist"", ""Vamp Calls To You"", ""BloodŒæBy Torchlight"", ""The Zombie And The Raven"" - $30,000Thanks again for checking this Kickstarter out and I hope you like and find it in yourself to support my vision."

1202," Hello Everyone,Thank you for taking the time to view my page!I am trying to raise money in order to get my story off the ground.So far the story is going along pretty slow, moving at a snails pace. My goal is to raise funds to hire someone that can help me out a bit with the story line and someone who can create the art work.My InspirationI was inspired to come up with a story when my son was born. I thought what kind of adventures will he go on? Will he have imaginary friends that he will play with? As I pondered on those questions, I came up with an idea to create a book, starring, my son, Nathan.The story.The story is about a young boy named Nathan, who has imaginary friends and they go on all these wild imaginary adventures out in the forest. One day Nathan, loses his favorite item while on his adventure and does not realize it until he is already back home. He sets out to find this item, when he becomes mysteriously ill and fall into a deep sleep.His imaginary friends embark on an adventure of their own in order to save Nathan from this mysterious sickness. Along the way they encounter obstacles that test their courage and love for Nathan and finally encounter their mysterious foe.Sound interesting?I think that this book will be awesome. So I ask, please, help me fund my project. I set my goal at a reasonable amount that will help get this story started.This is a labor of Love. A little Something to give to my Son, and hopefully something he can pass on to his children.I'll be posting my rough draft of the story soon on my flikr account. it will be bits and pieces of the story.Thank You for your time,Adam Y."
1203," Welcome to my Kickstarter. This here fundraiser is to make some awesome stickers from my awesome art. It helps me become more famous than I already am and it helps you collect some awesome stickers to stick around all your envious friends.I spend an awful lot of time drawing and doodling. In fact most these were created in the last two weeks. I like drawing and I am fairly good at it, if I do say so myself. I also like stickers and thats how this whole thing came about.There is no real rhyme or reason to these stickers just cool images I came up with that I thought would make a great sticker or t-shirt. But being a measly part-time employee at a toy store, I can't afford to do it on my own. That's where you come in to save the day.You choose which design goes on your clothes.T-shirts will be in black with the design of your choice.Hoodie colors choices are: White, Dark Grey, Heather Grey, Black, Brown and Navy.The majority, 60%, of your money will go to manufacturing fees, 20% to shipping, 10% goes to Kickstarter and Amazon fees, and the other 10% for any hidden / unforseen fees just in case. I am not trying to get rich, I am trying to get my name and my art out where people could see it.Cause if all goes well, I can see myself doing many more of these type projects, or even adding more designs to this one. So heres hoping.For any other information, questions or comments, insults or jokes, go towww.edgarborunda.com"

1205," This Summer, mac birmingham is hosting a special exhibition celebrating the work of Birminghamäó»s best-loved cartoonist Bert Hackett, or Gemini as he was so well-known to readers of the Birmingham Post newspaper. For generations of Brummies, the day didnäó»t begin until theyäó»d had a glimpse of the front page of the Post and enjoyed his clever, cartoon take on the news of the day, along with their cornflakes. Over 40 years, Bert, born and bred in Birmingham, produced more than 10,000 of those cartoons. The show will include around 70 of Bertäó»s works, capturing key moments of political life and popular culture, regionally, nationally and internationally, across the decades. We are asking for a contribution towards the costs of staging the exhibition (printing/ framing/ gallery lighting etc). ŒæIn return, mac birmingham is hosting an event to launch the exhibition and celebrate Bert's 80th birthday on the eve of the show, and all donors are invited. ŒæThere are three levels of rewards: Œ£15 and above buys you an invitation to the launch/80th birthday event and a slice of birthday cake. Œ£100 and above buys you your name listed on the walls of the gallery as an Exhibition Supporter for the duration of the show, a launch/ 80th birthday celebration invitation and a piece of birthday cake. Œ£500 or more buys you sponsorship of a cartoon in the show, and your name will be listed on the walls of the gallery as a Key Sponsor of the exhibition for its duration, and, of course, youäó»ll be invited to Bertäó»s launch celebration and have a slice of birthday cake. The exhibition is going to take place from 29 June to 1 September this year, in the Arena Gallery at mac birmingham in Cannon Hill Park. The launch event will be held on Bert's 80th birthday, 28th June. We need your help now! Please make a contribution and come and join us in celebrating one of Birminghamäó»s best-loved artists. Support us today and please help to spread the word about our show by sharing our project with your friends and family. Letäó»s give Bert a birthday to remember! Thank you for your support."

1209," We're using the art of illustration, screen printing and black light reactive inks to further explore the themes of duality and transformation in the Alice books by Lewis Carroll.ŒæThe goal of this series is to produce sixteen art prints as a collaboration between eight different artists. Each artist is illustrating two prints. One based on a character from the books, and another from a passage of their choosing or one of the original John Tenniel illustrations.ŒæThrough screen printing and the wonder of black light reactive inks, we're developing each illustration into an object with two states: one state in daylight and another, altered state under black light. The end result is a truly unique and curious narrative distilled into each print.Each of the eight contributing artists are excited to see this project happen with help from the kickstarter community. We've spent a lot of time working on these images and this concept to bring it to where it is today.ŒæSee our progress so far and find out more about each of us below.Rebecca Sugar -ŒæAnimator: Cartoon Networkäó»s Adventure Time and creator of Steven Universemore details on ""Alice""more details on the ""What is the Use of a Book?""Frans Boukas -ŒæIllustratormore details on ""The White Rabbit""more details on ""The Garden of Live Flowers""Noah Scalin - Artist/Author/Designer creator of Skull-A-Daymore details on ""Tea Party Costume""more details on ""Drink Me""James Callahan -ŒæIllustratormore details on ""The Slaying of The Jabberwock""more details on ""The Gryphon and the Mock Turtle""Meg Gandy -ŒæComics Artistmore details on ""The Red Queen""more details on ""The White Queen""Barry BrunerŒæ-ŒæEditorial Illustratormore details on ""The King""more details on ""The Walrus and the Carpenter""Matt Deans -ŒæIllustrator, Animatormore details on ""The Caterpillar""more details on ""Pig and Pepper""Spencer HansenŒæ-ŒæIllustrator, Designermore details on ""I Growl When I'm Pleased""details on ""Queen Kitty"" coming soonAs screen printers and illustrators, we started incorporating UV reactive and glow in the dark inks into our show posters and artwork a few years ago. Instead of emulating the traditional black light poster art of the sixties and seventies, we found ourselves experimenting with more subtle, balanced uses. We remained focused on creating images that were effective in regular lighting conditions, but also featured hidden details that would appear under a black light.ŒæFrans Boukas had been itching to further explore the themes of duality and transformation that are so central to Aliceäó»s experiences in Lewis Carroll's books. When we shared ourŒæexperiments with black light inks and presented the concept of the two states of an image, he realized this was the perfect fit. Straightaway he began pairing fellow illustrators with characters he wanted to see them take on, convincing us what a weird match this alternative style of image making would be for the characters and scenes in the books.Screen printing is a traditional printing method that gives the artist the ability to lay down individual areas of precise colors in a specific order. It has a long, rich history.ŒæThe classic black light posters of the sixties and seventies were screen printed because itäó»s the perfect way to work with these custom fluorescent and UV reactive inks.ŒæWithout screen printing these images don't work. It's the only effective way to create live, tangible versions of these dual images that can be really experienced in person instead of previewed on a computer screen.ŒæOur personal adventures with screen printing have led us to a close partnership with Triple Stamp Press, a skilled and experienced screen printing shop. They share our passion and have poured it into their process. They have the attention to detail, level of control, and taste for experimentation that will be required to take onŒæthe technical challenges of printing this very unique project.ŒæAlso, we share a building with Triple Stamp's shop allowing us to remain intimately involved at every step of the printing process.With your help, we'll finish the illustration, color, and printing of this series of sixteen, limited edition art prints. With a healthy dose of gratitude, we've made the completed prints available as rewards for your support. Many of these reward levels allow you to choose your favorite prints.

1213," I like to draw. I've illustrated throughout my life, and I've spent the last decade teaching others creative skills. Kickstarter is a perfect way for me to earn a little money for producing creative work, that I'd otherwise not realistically have resources to produce.This is a simple project which will have baring on some larger scale projects I want to work up to on kickstarter. This is simply illustration that would look good in your home, and a chance to own something not commercially available.I'm looking for just a small amount, as I have no production costs other than my time. If one person ends up funding me, then i'm happy to draw out these illustrations just for them, but if i get a lot more, then obviously this will give me a good start on doing something more adventurous, and it will give me a chance to bring value added rewards to backers of this project.Likewise, if you back me on higher tiers, then you're also covering the costs of materials. But the real thing you're buying is the personal touch, and the care I'll take in crafting something for you.You can see the quality of my digital artwork from my English Rose Digital Artwork project - and whilst this is a traditional illustration set, you can see some of my varied styles and media on my Facebook page.I do hope you find room in your pocket to give a small donation to this project and get rewards well worth the funds you pledge.Thanks very much for having a read through.-MS"
1214," I am creating the Portland Tarot deck at a rate of a card per week, with the aim of completing all 78 cards by October 10, 2014, but I need your help to get there.Each card is a stand-alone work of art, created through a process of blending original photography with digital collage to create crisp yet surreal images that visually and tonally evoke my adopted home town of Portland, Oregon.While Portland is the inspiration for this quirky, character-drivenand symbol-rich deck, you donäó»t have to live here to resonate with theenergy of this place or to appreciate it as a backdrop for Tarot. In addition to the unique visual slant of the art, my goal is to create a final deck package that is beautiful and well-designed. I'm KEEPING IT LOCAL and printing the deck in Portland, Oregon.The key design elements of the finished deck I will be printing next year:The cards will be a bit larger than average (3"" x 4.75""), allowing for more image while being easy to shuffleThe card stock will be thick enough for lasting use and has a nice smooth texture with a matte coating to prevent glareThe deck will come with a 100 page bookletThe deck and booklet will come packaged in a beautifully-constructed box with a velvety-soft finishThe whole thing will be printed locally in Portland, Oregon where I can personally assure the high standards of the finished product Making a deck is a massive undertaking, but Iäó»m ready! Iäó»vecompleted 10 cards to date, collected a large repository of landmark and accentphotos, and have finished studio shoots for subjects from 16 cards. But I havea lot of work ahead of me to complete the remaining 68 cards that comprise astandard 78 card Tarot deck. Priority One: Print a minimum of 2,500 decks locally and sustainably (including interpretation booklet and box)Priority Two: Get the funds I need for incidental expenses that I come across in creating the art and getting the deck out into the world (equipment, props, costumes, promotion, etc.)With your backing I canget at least 2,500 of the finished decks printed and can have a fund at theready for all the costs I will incur during the creation of the artwork. Each piece takes an average of 40 hours to complete (includingphotographing my subjects, collecting backgroundphotography, and putting together the final illustration) and costs me an average of $50 in various photo shoot expenses. I'm running a Kickstarter now because I need funding to finish making the art (overhead only, NOT for my own time) and I'd rather spend my time making art instead of later running a second Kickstarter to fund the printing. Efficiency!If you want to learn more about my approach, check out The Lovers card process.To get more info about the project and see all theart Iäó»ve completed so far, go to the official web site for The Portland Tarot. DeathDeath represents rebirth, regeneration, and shedding of the old. The subject, Brooke, had a strong connection with the Death card and suggested the day of the dead candy skull makeup. (It's a pretty popular costume choice in Portland for Halloween.) Behind her is the Vista Bridge. I chose to take a colorful, hopeful take on the card in effort to buck the trend of seeing this card as dark and frightening. The ChariotThis is The Chariot, starring my good friend, Tarot muse, and frequent collaborator Cynthia Lopez. (She made my Kickstarter video!) This is the illustration that started this whole project. If you're curious to know more, it's a great story, and you can read it on The Portland Tarot web site.The MagicianThis in-progress card stars my good friend and mentor Lee Moyer. He is a powerhouse of creativity and manifestation in his own right, and it seems even more fitting to have him in the Magician card with a deck of the Portland Tarot within the image, since he is part of the mojo helping bring this deck into the 3D world.The StarThis card features derby player Juvie Hall, with a dual scene incorporating the Hollywood Theatre and the Japanese Gardens, showing the tension between the energy of reaching to express our true self and passion in a world where we are expected to perform.The WorldIn a Portland Tarot deck, well, the World is actually Portland itself. And since Portlandia (the statue) had so many similarities with The World card, I thought it fitting for this card to be an homage to the statue. Springtime is the period in our city when everything seems right with the world, and so I chose a wreath of cherry blossoms instead of the usual laurel.Here are some questions I'd ask if I were in your shoes...78 pieces of artwork? Is she going to actually finish it?There is nothing Iäó»ve wanted more thanto create a Tarot deck. Iäó»ve had a blast so far, and with all the support Iäó»vereceived, thereäó»s no way I will back down!!! I am 100% committed.So, the answer to that question is a resounding, äóìYes.äó The bigger question is, are you going to join me on my journey? I hope so.Do I need to know or care about Portland to enjoy the finaldeck?No! In fact, I am doing my utmost to make sure the deckappeals to a general audience. The city is my muse, but you donäó»t have toknow it to find meaning and enjoyment from the deck itself. The symbols andimagery within will be universal, if more quirky and subversive than a more traditional deck.I've funded other deck projects on Kickstarter. Isn't your target budget a bit high?I realize that I have a higher-than-average target compared to most other card decks funded on Kickstarter, but my parameters are also different than many of them. Between the magnitude of the project (including up-front costs to completing the artwork), the added cost of printing locally (instead of overseas, where most deck companies go), and choosing a printing route of a higher quality, it will take a chunk of change to pull it off. After researching more affordable routes in printing, I strongly believe that taking the high road is the way to go. There is currently no extra room in my budget to put money in my own pocket. Every dollar in my target goal goes straight back into the project.The Made in Portlandia äóìArtsäó»näó»Craftsäó Upgraded DeckThis Kickstarter-only limited editiondeck will be custom-printed on a nicer stock, at a slightly larger size thanthe standard deck. The box will be decorated by myself or another local Portland artist andfinished by me. These decks will be numbered and each one is going to be a totally unique piece of art.Posing as a Card SubjectMany of the people who have posed forcards so far have revealed that their participation proved to be a powerfulexperience, during and after. I am very deliberate about who I collaborate with as a subject for each card,and the person I cast must fit the cardäó»s meaning in some way, either in theirpersonal story, or in the person they are actively working to become. For someof my models the card they posed for served as a totem for them, setting thetone for their chosen inner and outer journeys at the time.If you are feeling called to partake of this reward, then I know in my bones you are meant to be in this deck. I am eagerly anticipating getting to know you!If you choose to claim this reward level, we willschedule a call or meeting so I can get to know your story and more about your current inner and outer journey. Iäó»ll get a sense of your likes and dislikes, working to understand you and yourpersonal style. (This is something I am highly regarded for in my business, asclients often claim I have a special knack for deeply listening and äóìgettingäówho they truly are and what they are reaching for.) From there, I will choose a potentialcard or two for you from those that I have yet to illustrate, on which youwill have an opportunity to give approval. Iäó»ll pitch my suggested design directionto you, but you will also have the opportunity to contribute your own input and insights.Every card I create is a collaborative process between me and my subject.Whatever meditations you bring to the table about the chosen card will flavorwhat I create.Then weäó»ll make plans for the photoshoot, including makeup and hair. Youäó»ll have a luxurious and fun half day of art play in mystudio, from which youäó»ll get a couple of outtake images that youäó»ll be free touse however you like, within a couple of days after the shoot.When the illustration is completed,youäó»ll get a framed and signed 14"" x 20"" metallic print of the artwork that you canhang up at home, as well as twenty 5"" x 7""s of your finished piece to hand out tofriends and family.The entire process is guided byintuition and creative play, and your presence will forever be enjoyed inreadings worldwide. Plus youäó»ll have the beautiful satisfaction of knowing yousupported an artist in creating something truly special that will live on for futuregenerations.High-End Fine Art Deck and Carved BoxThis is a special offering forhigh-level äóìpatron saintäó contributors for this project. This one-of-a-kind offering includes higher-quality print, large art cards äóî each hand-signed by me. I will workclosely with the local marionette artist Geahk Burchill of CastIron Carouselto design a unique wooden box that he will then hand carve. You may also opt toinclude a symbol in the carving that is of personal significance to you. Inaddition to the custom deck and box, you will receive a framed and signed 14"" x20"" metallic print of your choosing.Rewards That May Require TravelFor folks taking advantage of the Tarot Night or Posing as Deck Subject rewards, it is not out of the question to request that I travel to you. However, in most cases I will not be able to cover this cost out of my own pocket, and we will have to discuss arrangements before you make your pledge. Contact me to discuss your particular circumstances, and we can go from there.  (In the case of the Posing reward, I request that you come to my studio so we can make use of my equipment there, but if you are passionate about being a participant and travel is not possible for you, I am willing to find a way to accommodate.)I am a self-employed graphic designer,web developer, and business consultant, and have been managing my ownsuccessful designand development business for nearly seven years. I moved from Mississippi to Portland in2002. Since I started reading Tarot in 2008, Iäó»ve wanted to makemy own Tarot deck, with ideas for styles, imagery, and specific card slantsthat could meet the needs I had begun to crave in a deck for myself.I bring a huge reservoir of experienceto this project, between my own design and Tarot experience and the incredible support ofmy various team members. If you want to know more about my Kickstarter video or the other people who made this Kickstarter possible, I posted credits on The Portland Tarot website."

1217," Hello, my name is Turrel. I am the Creative Director at Dzxtinkt Originals LLC. Dzxtinkt has partnered with Dave Williams of DaveWill Design to create an unofficialŒæalternative poster for The Help.The duration of this Kickstarter project is 25 days. 25 to honor the 1925 birth of Medgar Evers. He was the first field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi.After admiring the artwork of Dave Williams from afar for the last 2 years and watching him evolve as an artist, I was deeply honored to hire him for this project. Dave has spent numerous hours illustrating, designing, perfecting and researching this poster.ŒæDave Williams Artist Statement""Illustrating a new poster for The Help was a brilliant experience which I really enjoyed. Here is a little bit of background info on the design of the print. I knew I had to stick to 3 or 4 colours so the poster could be easily screen printed and after watching the movie again a couple of times I settled on the yellow, turquoise, green and white palette that you see above. The inspiration for this came right out of the movie itself, with these colours being repeatedly seen throughout the film. I also wanted to get some stark contrast in the design through the use of black and white as a reference to the themes of race which are central to the story.I noticed upon watching the film that the use of telephones was a recurring theme. Often, news was spread via the central characters calling family or friends as news of Skeeter's book spread across Jackson. This idea formed the outer layer of my design, with a character sitting in each corner of the print based on scenes taken from the movie. I also wanted to ensure that the infamous pie Minnie baked was at the centre of the design, along with Skeeter's typewriter that caused so much controversy. The line 'You is kind, you is smart, you is important' had a big impact on me as I watched the movie so I knew I had to fit that in there somewhere too. Overall the poster aims to display some of the most iconic moments of the film, acting as a lasting reminder to this great movie.""Project DetailsThe Help was Kathryn Stockett's first novel. It took her five years to complete the novel. Did you know that it was rejected by 60 literary agents before Susan Ramer agreed to represent Stockett? The novel was later adapted into an Award winning motion picture starring Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson.In, The Help a young, aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the early 1960s decides to write a controversial book detailing the struggles of African-American maids living in Jackson Mississippi. In the novel, black maids talk about what its like to work for white households and take care of white children.You are probably wondering why we chose to do a poster for The Help. Our mission at Dzxtinkt is to create art that is inspired by under served and overlooked films, books, games, etc. We have become frustrated with the status quo of the alternative poster industry so we made this poster to start diversifying an industry that we are now a part of and we want to shake things up a bit.ThisŒæ24x36 inch posterŒæcaptures the incredible emotion and inspiration ŒæofŒæThe Help. The posters will be beautifully screen printed on thick paper and each print will be hand numbered.ŒæOne poster is $35 and includes shipping anywhere in the US; $45 for anywhere else in the world.Dzxtinkt Originals has attempted to use KickstarterŒæonceŒæin the past. Our first project was not successful so lets make this project a success. I would love for you to be a part of this funding campaign!ŒæA lot of progress has been made to bring poster illustration, a dying art form, back to life, but there is still a lot more work to do. It all starts right here right now with you, with your support. So, come join us. Be distinct. Be original."
1218," My project is all about fun. I have been a freelance illustrator for approximately twenty years, creating images for clients to the specifications that are given to me. The one area of creativity that I thoroughly enjoy is caricature and story book style illustration. Within my project I will illustrate an original portrait image in a crazy caricature style that over emphasizes the subjectäó»s features, while still retaining a likeness of that person or pet. A caricature is very different from a photo, in that it highlights the person in a comedic facial pose. It is not meant to be a realistic portrayal of every detail of that individual. It is meant to make someone smile.ŒæWe will share mutual enjoyment äóñ I will be able to create and share my unique illustrations with you, while you will receive an original hand signed piece of artwork with any pledge of $30.00 or more. For all pledges less than $30.00, one of the unique caricatures created throughout this project will be provided as your reward for pledging for my project.Œæ The images may also be used by me for portfolio purposes and posted to my website.I have paper, pencils and watercolors waiting to illustrate your people and pets. In order to illustrate effectively, please provide hi-resolution (minimum dimensions of 640x480 px), quality photos of the subjects along with any details of the individuals that might be utilized in the final illustration.Illustration sizes of 5"" x 7"", 10"" x 14"", and 16"" x 20"" are all image size. Paper size will be slightly larger. Many thanks to my dog, Mochi, for her commentary."

These cards are a unique expression of the African American experience in America throughout history. I have been selling them at festivals and street fairs the last few summers in Los Angeles. I now want to reach a larger audience and take it to the next level. This is where Kickstarter comes in. I have the opportunity to showcase my cards at The LA mart show coming up in June. The money raised will allow me to set up the booth and produce all the marketing for this show."

1221," Hi everybody, i'm simply trying to get prints made out of illustrations i've recently been posting on my website and facebook.These illustrations started out as a mirror of my currant relationship with aŒævery dear friend of mine. They represent the many adventures we've been sharing so i feel they can speak to all sorts of people's thoughts and feelings about love and life in this wild world. These illustrations are just a sampling of what i've worked out with my friend but you can bet the Universe that more are on the way!I am represented as Red and he is represented as Yellow.They are the Flower Catchers.Together, the two of these boys explore anotherside of existence, traveling from fiendish meadow to loftus airways, becomingmore connected and disconnected from one another as each of them discoverunique perspectives to strange circumstances.Obviously Iäó»ve grown a sort of obsession with the inner workings of eachday that has remained within my mind of Red and Yellowäó»s relationship, and so Iäó»dsuppose it has grown into a Musing of a relationship.One good day can churn me out a lovely sceneof Red and Yellow dancing in the flowers, and another, maybe moody odd day, candismantle my love and curve thoughts into darker infestations.This project has been ongoing for almost a year now and Iäó»venever been happier.I went to New Yorkand Los Angeles for college but neither worked out, so Iäó»ve been in this slowspiraling decline of äóÖWhat do I do with my art and lifeäó» but now I think Iäó»ve realizedmy passion, and itäó»s pretty much this: to illustrate my life and the Muse Iäó»vecome to adore and sometimes loath.Thesepassed months have been a huge learning experience with living on my own and thensharing my life with another person.Hopefullyyou will see and cherish the fun that can be had in being alive and just doingsomething special with another human being that Iäó»ve been lucky enough toencounter.As the end goal, Iäó»m hoping to get my illustrations allcanvased and put up in a local gallery and make prints forfriends and family and You!This is acontinuing project so of course there will be more illustrations coming withinthe weeks and months and yearŒæthat follow, so Iäó»ll be busy getting those workedout.Also as aŒæanother project, Iäó»ll beillustrating a short story for a childrenäó»s book i've been developing.This is sort of sidebar-ish, but itäó»s going to be an origin story for Trees called the EctoplasmicTree.Haha but thatäó»s a story foranother time, so once I get this project in a gallery, thatäó»ll be my next stepand hopefully get self-published or with a publishing house!!! So life ismoving forward nowadays and I canäó»t wait to see what comes next.Oh, an All the Rewards will be using the ArtWork from ""The Adventures of D/P!?!?!?""

1222," How This All StartedLast year I got cancer and had to under go 7 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. I am cancer free now but during that time my karate students really stepped up and helped me out.I wanted to send them a thank you card and discovered that there really were not any good options for a card with a martial arts theme. They had silly ones, they had ones with stereotypical sayings (Glad you kicked it!) and very few with kanji. The ones with kanji were very poorly made. The kanji was terrible. It was obviously not done by a real person.It was then that I decided to create a line of greeting cards specifically for martial artists from the perspective of a martial artist. I have been studying karate, kobudo and judo for over 25 years and have the rank of Rokudan (6th degree black belt). So I thought the best place to start was from what I know, Japanese martial arts.The Original SetI created my first set of cards using some the most common sayings, words, and maxims in martial arts. I used things like:I found someone expert in shodo (Japanese calligraphy) to create the kanji (Chinese character set) for each card.ŒæThen I had to find a way to transfer the kanji from paper to computer without losing the brush strokes and the qualities that display kanji as a true work of art. This required a scanner that could do very high resolution scans.Why I Chose This MediaI run my own dojo and am always sending notes to my students. I send welcome notes, congratulations on rank promotions, thank you cards, and various other cards and notes to them all the time.I thought the best way to make these cards available to the pubic was to have them as PDF files that you can download and then print as often as you want. That way you can send a birthday card to very student just by printing it out at home and sending it.Adding PostersThen I thought it would be nice to have the kanji on posters that I could hang at the dojo. But I needed a way to convert the kanji from the scan into a scalable image. This requires special software.You can see by the photo that the character of the strokes is maintained even at 300% zoom.Because the kanji is so flexible and can be created at any size I created 5 poster sizes:I also created international paper sizes in the A series. Each card, and each poster, also has 4 configuration options as explained in the opening video.Where I Am NowThey turned out great and now I want to expand the line with 15 new cards. That's the focus of this project. I want to have the shodo master create all new kanji, transfer them to the computer and build the cards.I need your help to do this. It costs time and money to create the template for each card. As a reward you will get a complete PDF package of one card or more, depending on your support level, as well as other rewards.The New CardsI've decided on the cards I will be producing for this project. There are 15 cards as mentioned above. Here are the titles for them.The 7 Virtues of BushidoHajime - BeginningYudansha - Black BeltToukon - Fighting SpiritIppon - Full PointBujutsu - Martial ArtsBudo - Martial WayBushido - Warrior WayOsu - I will do my bestHayku ren jitoku - Practice makes perfectZanshin - Focused readinessKarate ne sente nashi - There is no first strike in karateDo mu gen - There is no end to learning the wayMushin - no mindSensei - TeacherThese have some great meaning behind them and I have begun creating the write ups for each card. Every card has a paragraph or two describing the card's word, saying or maxim.An example from the card ""nana korobi ya oki"" or ""seven times down eight times up"" is shown below:Because the image is small I have written the text below.The literal translation of this proverb makes no sense. You can not get up more times than you go down. But, as is often the case, you must look beyond the obvious to discover the hidden meaning.What we are being told is to persevere. When life knocks you down - get up. When life knocks you down again - get up again.Your martial arts training will give you the fortitude to overcome adversity. As you train, you are told over and over to do it better, do it stronger. Apply this to life and you have the courage and the ability to stand back up again.Backer ChoiceAs backers you will be able to choose which card(s) you want from this list. Please share this project with your friends so we can get the word out about it. I would love be able to offer these cards to all martial artists.Arigato!Thank you for taking time to review and support my project. With your support I can advance this project and offer more cards to more martial artists around the world.Please tell your friends about this and share it with them. As martial artists we are all family."
1223," The Drok Days Anthology started as an outlet for my suburban frustration, and as a way of coping with nightmares.Œæ The anthology will consist of a professionally printed book of paintings of twisted characters, narrative text, and Hip Hop Poetry.Œæ All telling the story of a tormented young man interacting with a world of demons, aliens, living graffiti, and a city hellbent on self destruction.I am raising funds to self publish the Anthology.Œæ The funds raised will go directly to printing the books as well as creating promotional materials to send to publishers.Œæ I face the challenge that all self publishing authors and artists face, chiefly funding.Œæ Without the help of Kickstarter funding the Anthology will likely not receive a wider audience.After funding is secured, a limited run of prints will be created to send to investors as well as publishing houses.Œæ Funding will also be used to secure protection for the legal rights to the Drok Days properties including character images, text, and names."

1228," Hi, I'm James LaVigne. Being one of Spokane's more successful, well-known fine artists for the past 40 years, you're probably familiar with my work, although you may not be aware of that fact, unless you live in the area.I've had a fascination with the incredible architecture of Gonzaga University since my early childhood, and the beautiful, enormous landscapes with the powerful Spokane River cutting through them.To capture the dynamic campus, students and beautiful landscapes, and with Gonzaga celebrating 125 Years, it seemed fitting to commemorate this historical moment with an Art Show of exceptional quality art images for April 2014, which I will create over the next 12 months.ŒæThese 12 intaglio etchings will look as they were created three centuries ago by a master's lyrical, free-flowing hand.ŒæIntaglio printing is an art form dating back to the Old World Masters and is practiced today by only a very few true craftsmen with the talent, skills and specialized equipment necessary for the process.ŒæThis will be a rare and exclusive opportunity, making this limited edition run of intaglio prints extremely valuable.ŒæJoin the venture and own part of this commemorative project celebrating Gonzaga University's rich legacy.Cut off date will be April 30th, so that I have the time necessary to produce this exceptional show.Investors at the $900 level or more will receive a personal tour of the James Franics LaVigne's Studio and an etching demonstration when they take delivery of their etchings (air fare, food and lodging not included).Link to KSPS TV (Public TV Station) video on Northwest Profiles. http://video.ksps.org/video/1954364222/ This 7 minute video has Charlie Hinton from the Wm Grant Gallery & Framing and has Karen Mobley, 15 years as Spokane City Arts Director on it commenting about my work and me. (This link works fine on my laptop, but no so well on my iPhone. KSPS TV video is also viewable on my website).Museum Quality Framing is also available:  $75.00 per 8""x10"" frame: Museum glass, spacers to keep the etching away from the glass and acid free backing. You may choose from either a 1"" Burl wood from Italy or a 1"" black beaded Hogarth frame. Framing of the posters is not available. Add $15 for shipping per frame inside contiguous US and $25 for overseas delivery. These orders will be filled by Wm Grant Gallery Œæand Framing.FundsŒæŒæSome of the funds will be used to bring my etching press and other related equipment up to premier level, so the etchings will be of the finest quality possible. I'll also need to purchase the Arches 100% rag paper, which is considered to be among the finest papers in the world, especially crafted for fine art production of etchings. The balance of the funds will cover the cost of a printing assistant to help me with the printing process.ŒæThe ProcessŒæ For those wishing to be bored out of their minds; you might want to grab a cup of coffee to stay awake during this.ŒæWell, if you'd like to know how the process works, the etchings will be created from very detailed & delicate drawings, drawn backwards, with a stylus, through beeswax on a zinc plate in the manner of the Old World Masters (and on top of that, the lines are not black but shiny silver (fresh, shiny zinc) with unlined areas dark brown (wax) which makes it even harder as it is  with the image flopped (image is backwards) and in reverse (black is shiny silver and white is dark brown). Intaglio etching lines can be very sublime, subtle and subdued, carrying emotion & feeling, and also record the sometimes heavy lines, which in combination with the light lines reflect the artist's perception of people, landscapes in the distance, structures and air (very delicate and faint)- atmospheric conditions, clouds, etc in which etching lends itself, together with the plate tone. This is achieved by the length of time each of the lines is bathed in the acid. Stronger, more powerful lines are bitten (etched) longer. After each intaglio etching plate is drawn and bathed in acid, it is then heated on a plate warmer, rubbed with ink using a dabber to force the ink into the grooved lines, then wiped with tarlatan lightly, leaving a plate tone on the unbitten portion of the plate. The plate is one of the reasons each etching is considered an original print, as each is slightly different. Then the wet heavy etching paper, which has soaked in a water bath for sixteen hours, is blotted to remove excess water and placed over the warm plate on the press bed. It is then covered with three felt blankets and run through the press. The blankets are removed and then the paper (8""x10"") is ""torn"" from the plate (it actually sounds like it is tearing). This is done slowly as it needs time to release, and wallah (or Voila) - you have an etching! However, we're not done yet. It takes three or four days to dry the etchings, rotating the blotter paper every twelve hours, to prevent foxing later (mildew or fungi spotting), and carefully replacing the weights which prevent the etchings from curling. You must not be too heavy with the weights, as you want to see the emboss from the plate. The ""plate mark""  is one of the ways to determine whether an etching is truly an authentic or original work of art.  Now you now the facts behind true ""etchings"", so when someone invites you up to see their etchings, you'll know your stuff.Thank you for considering my project. James LaVigneStudioEvery artist needs space to work and I found one this one 22 years ago that meets most of my needs- big enough (2,750 sq ft), centrally heated with air conditioning in the heart of Downtown Spokane, WA.SEVERAL OF MANY SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED ART PROJECTSThe Spokane GrandfatherThe original sold for $30,000 and I located five Sponsors at $22,500.Courthouse Tower PrintCourthouse In BlueBFA show at Avant Guarde Gallery Fort Wright College 1980Spokane City Hall Show in conjunction with The National Trust for Historic Preservation.

1229," My vision is to establish a solid, high quality list of life inspiring picture books for the digital reader format, initially to be made available through Amazon, Apple iBooks store, and a dedicated site.Children read pictures, and are introduced to words through them, and play is an essential element to any good picture book.ŒæThe potential for both these realities to be explored through the interaction and audio possibilities of eReaders, which are really in their infancy at this time, is very exciting.I have a vision to produceŒæfun, educational and spiritually enriching interactive digital picture books for children, in both fiction and non-fiction areas.Now the simple story is recently I've been trying to hobble together my fist eBook using an old power pc mac and pages software, and discovered quite quickly that I need new hardware and software to get this project underway.

1230," Georgia And Nathan will be a graphic novel which explores one AmericanŒæsouthern family's challenge and denial in dealing with a hidden truth about one senior family member's involvement in the Holocaust as a collaborator with the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto. It is told through the eyes of that family's twenty year old daughter, Georgia, who has to confront the fact that her hero, her grandfather, who she has worshipped all of her life, is not whom she thinks he is. This is a story about casting off the demons of one's past and learning to let go of one's prejudices and being open to change, in your heart and in your mind. And, it is also about learning to forgive.ŒæI have already written the script for the graphic novel. I am raising funds so that I can hire a team of comic book / graphic novel illustrators to create the art illustrations for the book. Than I intend to approach publishers or to self publish the work myself.I have also written a screenplay for ""Georgia And Nathan"" and my intention is to develop that into a feature film which I plan to direct.When one examines the available content in the graphic novel or comic book industry these days, there is a limit to the availability of work that examines significant historical events. It is my hope that this graphic novel, which focuses on denial of the Holocaust, might be embraced by children, young adults and beyond so that it's readers may learn about denial and forgiveness, especially when the stakes are so high as to threaten the very existence of a family's structure."
1231," About the bookAs a caricature artist I'm often asked the question 'Can I learn to do that or is it a natural born talent?'. Truth is, I couldn't draw them when I was born so I guess it must have been what I like to call 'The 4 P's'.When I was a kid there weren't too many books on the subject of caricature, and there certainly wasn't any internet to try and find the information I needed on the subject. It was only after years of practise and hard work that I started to feel I had begun to figure out some of the techniques for drawing people in an amusing way. If I had access to the amount of information we have now back then, I certainly would've improved a heck of a lot faster. So why make this book? Well, firstly I love to teach, and I love to draw. Secondly, I totally appreciate how frustrating it can be to try and learn something on your own, so with this book I'm hoping that budding caricaturists can learn the techniques quicker and easier.The FormatThe format of this book is very simple. The beginning chapters deal with the basics needed to start caricaturing. Starting with simple shapes and learning to see facial features in a simplified form, we can take out some of the complexity and confusion of drawing faces and approach each new picture with confidence. And have fun at the same time! I thought a great idea would be to have some lucky readers have their very own caricature of themselves drawn in the book, along with tips on how I drew them. What a great way to learn and have a memento of your personal pledge to this book! In general, the book will contain a wide variety of subjects to study from and learn the art of caricature.It's my hope to make this book as detailed and informative as possible, and the best way to do that is to have as many demonstrations as possible for you to study from.Digital caricaturesThe book will also include a section on digital caricatures. I will show you to sketch, ink and colour your caricature work in popular design software.So much content!!!As well as learning the art of caricature and how to create digital caricatures, I will also include a section on taking a caricature portrait into Toon Boom's 'Animate Pro' software and show you how to animate it with lip syncing to an audio track. How many other caricature 'how to' books offer this many techniques! ŒæThis is a technique that is useful for advertising, email greeting cards and personal animation projects!RewardsThere are many reward schemes available for this project. You can be in the book as one of the featured caricatures and there are various options available. A great Œægift for a budding caricature artist might be to give them this digital book as a gift. Imagine their surprise when they flick through and find themselves on their very own page!ŒæEither way, it's a great way to support this project and become such a huge part of it at the same time.Where does the funding go?For any creative project the main issue is time. With your support I can put this project ahead of everything I have to do and deliver the best quality product possible and earlier! I have already made a start on this book and I would love to give it my undivided attention so this is where the funding will go!"

1236," The Death of Small TownsSlowly and methodically the American small town is being eliminated, from our hearts and minds and our everyday reality.

Food and food stores have changed, the small Ma & Pa groceries are few and far between, hanging on by a thread.the family hardware stores are all but gone.

1237," Are you a Jazz junkie? Are you a fan of Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker and Chet Baker? Junkies?Œæ Collectible art prints? Cool French absinthe drinking cats?Œæ I love them all and have spent countless hours producing what I hope is the first in a series of limited edition prints.Œæ On certain Jazz discussion boards the title of my prints has become controversial, so please allow me to explain my intentions: Œæ I am not trying to glorify addiction---I'm lamenting it... These prints bear testament to my intentions and are a protest not for, but against junk addiction.These 3 prints were designed as a triptych (see image below), but look great alone and are available for individual purchase.ŒæŒæWhat is a triptych and why as a triptych?Œæ According to Wikipedia,""The triptych form arises from early Christian art"" and the why is that my prints are clearly meant to have religious significance.Œæ A traditional triptych might look like this:In my prints, Charlie Parker is compared to the Buddha and the text extracted from ""Mexico City Blues"" is quite obviously a prayer to Charlie Parker--A prayer for forgiveness.ŒæŒæI also put a halo behind his head to make my intentions clear.ŒæŒæSo, we have Charlie as god--Buddha-- as the center panel, flanked by the other parts of what forms a holy trinity.Notice that both the heads of Chet Baker and Billie Holiday are at the same level, which is significantly lower than Charlie Parker's as traditionally triptychs had a larger center panel.My intention was to take culturally iconic images and give them back, or give them, their proper iconic significance(in the true religious sense of that word), ..by framing them as strictly religious pieces.These prints were designed to be issued as a collectible hand-signed and numbered limited edition.Œæ Only a maximum of 100 of each print will ever be printed and only 99 will be available for sale, as I really would like to keep 1 set for myself.Why these three Jazz greats?Œæ Frankly, they are among my favorite Jazz vocalists and innovators. Each of whom eventually was to succumb to the very same demons which perhaps allowed them to reach new pinnacles in their respective forms.Œæ By carefully selecting fragments of lyrics from some of my favorite songs of theirs, and in the case of Charlie Parker, letting Jack Kerouac's famous elegy (Charlie Parker died on Kerouac's 33rd birthday), referenced here, tell the story, I think I've succeeded in visualizing the beauty and tragic dichotomy of their lives.Œæ My goal was to make the prints as musical as possible, with text and images that swirl and swing, telling the tales of their too brief lives.Œæ Look closely and listen.See larger view HERE:See larger view HERE:See larger view HERE:After an extensive and exhaustive search for the ideal printer, I chose Continental ID out of Sparta, MI.Œæ For over 75 years, this incredible company has provided excellence and is world renowned for having printed Stephen Frykholm's Herman Miller picnic posters from the 70äó»s, 80äó»s and 90äó»s. As a company, their printing services are in high demand.Œæ Happily, they have agreed to produce these prints for me and will make their services available to get the prints out as promised.Œæ I live in California and the shipping costs alone are considerable, but I've elected to go with the best.Excalibur, the cat, 6""x 4"" postcard:Should the funding exceed the goal by 10% or more, all backers will also receive a 'so cool' 3D lenticular postcard as my personal thank you.Lenticular postcard link:I already have my next series in mind--It will be called, ""The Father, Son and Holy Goof"" and will be another triptych of 3 of my favorite Beats: Jack Kerouac(father), Allen Ginsberg(son) and of course Neal Cassady as the holy goof.Œæ I can't wait to get started on that project, so implore everyone you know to get this funded asap.Love and kisses,Excalibur and Kamiblue"
1238," Hi, my name is Tim Flanagan, I'm a simple story teller. I have written two Sci-Fi / Fantasy / Adventure books for Teens and Young Adults in a series called The Moon Stealers. The third is due to be released in April, followed by the fourth in December 2013 and an Omnibus edition in 2014. I am looking for support in funding some unique artwork for the covers of the books by an incredibly talented artist (selection of his artwork is on this page).But first, I'm sure you want to know a bit more about the books.The idea for The Moon Stealers arrived unexpectedly one morning in the bathroom. My son, who enjoys sharing the only peaceful time I get to truly be on my own, randomly asked me to tell him a story. James has a great imagination so I knew that only a wild and exciting story would amuse him (plus there had to be some form of death and destruction in it.) So I randomly said, äóÖHave you heard the one about the Moon Stealers?äó» and the seed of imagination began. During our time in the bathroom, we threw loads of ideas at each other and concocted a sort of story for the Moon Stealers. I decided to start writing it down, not really knowing where it was going, but as I started to write I found that the ideas seemed to organically grow by themselves and the story grew into something much bigger than we first thought. The Moon Stealers series tells the story of an alien bacteria that lands on the Earth inside a meteor. As it evolves and grows it becomes a serious threat to civilisation. At the same time, a group of children unknowingly hold the key to saving the planet, whilst attempting to rescue one of their friends from an ancient portal that leads to another world.If you follow this link it will take you to my blog which contains an interactive book shelf where you will be able to read sample chapters of the first two books. The first book was released in June 2012, followed by the second in September 2012. To date over 4,000 copies have been sold. With the release of the third book imminent, I wanted to create a new branding for the series that would be more appealing to a younger audience. Having such a strong visual image on the cover is instantly appealing for children who, more often than not, do actually 'judge a book by its cover.' Eye catching cover art will help drive sales as well as provide a visual aid when presenting it to script writers and movie studios. The books would also be great to turn into graphic novels (but that's another project!)Please donate what you can so that this project can get off the ground. The funds will buy 4 pieces of artwork that will be produced based on a scene from each of the books. A 5th will also be created for the Omnibus edition of all four books. Everyone who kindly donates, no matter whether it is Œ£2 or Œ£2500, will have their name forever immortalized in print as a 'Kickstarter Supporter' within the acknowledgements section of all four books, as well as the omnibus edition.Please join me on this adventure and be part of something special from the very beginning. Thank you.Note : If the goal is exceeded then the additional money will be put towards getting another cover done for a new book due for release in 2014 called - 'Doctor Gabriel Grey, the finest Dragon Slayer in Westminster.' It's a book about Dragons in London in the 1600's"

1244," The goal of this campaign is to complete the 50+ images needed to expand The Stolen Child Tarot into a complete 78 card tarot deck, create a companion guide ebook and produce an independent print run of decks comparable in price and quality to current commercial decks.**As little as a $5 pledge gets you a copy of the companion E-book!**The Stolen Child Tarot is a project conceived by illustrator Monica Knighton (me!) and was inspired by the William Butler Yeats poem of the same name. ŒæThe key inspiration came from the refrain:äóìCome away, O human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.äóInitially, the deck began on a smaller scale, as a Major Arcana deck to be produced as a limited edition artist portfolio.  A previous Kickstarter project accomplished this goal, even allowing extra funding for upgrades in paper and a unique woodgrain and leaf paper portfolio.  You can visit the original funded campaign here:I was completely blown away by the response to the artwork for this project!  Lots of people have asked me about expanding the deck, and lots and lots of people on message boards, forums, etc have said they love the art, but they want/need a full deck at the price of the commercial ones out there.Œæ...But here's the rub...Publishers don't pay an advance on tarot art.  The other tarots I've done, Tarot of the Dead, published by Llewellyn and the art for The Healing Tarot, coming out this year with Schiffer was all produced on spec.  What's spec?  It means you make the art and then you get paid months, even years later, if there's enough in royalties.  ...Or as I like to put it, if you want to  live, you'll need a time machine to buy your groceries.  To give you an idea of the upfront workload, if it takes you about a week to research, rough, pencil and paint a card, you can multiply that times 80 (78 cards + titles/cardback) and then there's the guidebook... um, let's just say it's A LOT of work to do on spec!  A little more on that later...Currently, with the Major Arcana complete, what remains to expand this deck into a full tarot are the 50+ remaining Minor Arcana cards, and 4-5 new paintings for the card back design, title cards and box design äóñ all of which I hope to complete in the same quality and detail as the Majors äóñ and the writing and formatting of an expanded guide book.Very much like the Majors!  As with the original images, this deck is still a return to nature with no man made objects included and many traditional symbols re-envisioned with natural objects.  I've provided some samples of completed Minors in the video and some inks below.The suits would be:Oak (Pentacles) represented by the acornZephyrs (Swords) represented by the feather blown on the windBrine (Cups) represented by the shellsFlame (Wands) represented by the tongues of fireI also have some conceptual themes that would cross suits of the Minors, for example, the two's will explore balance in nature by featuring animals that have become extinct.Unlike the Major arcana edition, each image will include titles and numbers on the standard tall tarot-size coated stock with rounded corners.The final product would be a full 78 card deck and 2 title cards in a matching tuck box and a downloadable PDF guide book that includes thumbnails of each card for easy identification.  I've researched printers and found a reputable one whose product I feel is equal in quality to the decks produced by commercial publishers.  Does the funding goal seem like a lot?  I won't lie äóñ it feels like a moonshot to me...  But the budget is also pared down to the minimum.  And honestly, I don't have the resources to do this project on spec.  This project is truly a test to see if there's audience out there for this work and a chance for you to employ an artist!  (At fast food wages I might add!) ŒæI want this to be my job for 2013. ŒæWill you hire me?March äóñ November 2013: complete artwork and rough draft of guideDecember 2013: pre press work/prepare images for printerJanuary 2014:Œædeliver images and proof approvalFeb -March 2014: complete ebook guide while decks are at printersMarch 2014: schedule completion party and begin shipping rewards.This campaign will cover a 2000 deck print run, and ALL of those decks will need to be spoken for in order for the project to hit it's goal. ŒæWhat does that mean? ŒæIt means if you want one, you need to support the campaign! ŒæIn addition to completed copies of the deck, I'm offering a lot of one of kind and unique rewards for this project too! ŒæI'm in the process of designing a laser cut 2-3 inch lapel pin with imagery from the deck and text from the poem -- This will only be available through the campaign!Œæ Œæ There's also an opportunity to place your own totem animal within the deck and many pieces of original art available. ŒæOn a budget? ŒæThe ebook will have all images from the deck and expanded meanings and interpretation notes!Kickstarter is an ""all or nothing"" funding platform -- if a project doesn't reach its goal before the campaign ends, no money changes hands. The payment goes through Amazon and your card does not get charged until the campaign reaches its funding deadline. Œæ(March 16th.)If you pledge, during the campaign you can edit that pledge at any time - increase it, decrease it, cancel it. ŒæIt's very flexible. ŒæThere are all sorts of different pledge levels where you can receive different rewards - so you can think of it as a sort of pre-sale, however if the funding goal isn't met, just as no money changes hands, no rewards are sent.Short answer? No.The object of this campaign is to see if there's enough interest to bring a complete Stolen Child Tarot into the world. ŒæI wish I could say that I have some extra resource that would allow me to do it anyway, or do it in my free time, but I don't. ŒæMy first priority is to do whatever work I can to pay the bills. As an artist, I have a lot of different ideas I'd like to develop, so I feel testing ideas on Kickstarter is a good way to make an informed choice of where to put my energy. ŒæUm, so that's my roundabout way of saying, nope, if the goal isn't met, I'll need to move on to another project.I would love to increase the print run! ŒæRight now the goal covers just production for Kickstarter rewards. ŒæWe would need to raise $3000 beyond the current goal to increase the print run, which would allow me to offer the deck at shows, in my etsy shop, and some other online outlets.Pretty dang cool.  Seriously, you will hear your coats fighting in the closet over whose lapel it goes on.  They will be made by my friends at Ink It Labs.Whew!Did I miss something?

But right now, I simply want to get the images out there, and let people know that 'we are not alone', and that the Swaggernauts have landed here on Earth. The best way to do that is to introduce them to you. I want to do 6 color prints for the comic conventions I will be attending in 2013 to help me get the word out about the Swaggernauts. There are some great rewards here to thank you for your support, and for spreading the word about it. These range in the form of the prints themselves, original artwork, posters, and t-shirts. This is a dream to get this project off the ground so I would really appreciate any and all help to get this to WonderCon in March and introduce the Swaggernauts to the world!"
1253," I recently created a set of bold stark artwork based on some of Shakespeares best known works. The work is all done.A Midsummer Nights Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, Henry v, Anthony and Cleopatra, Twelfth Night, ŒæThe Tempest, Julius Caesar and Richard 3rd.ŒæThe feedback has been lovely and really positive and I am hoping to exhibit the images next year. I need the funds to buy the frames and mounts for these 12 A3 images and any extra promotional costs for the exhibition.ŒæAny help is gratefully accepted.Please check out my new website for more work and also to keep updated.http://www.gavindobson.comThanksHere are some of the images:"
1254," During the period of 1880-1910 known as the Gilded Age, New York City had become the city of the future. ŒæIndustry,Œæcommerce, architectureŒæand entertainment were just a few of the strongholds that Manhattan could boast about. ŒæThere had never been a city like New York. Dreams were born and created here and anything was possible.My main focus is on a small stretch of streets between 34th and 23rd, South of Broadway. ŒæIt's an epic location. Vaudeville, Edison, Tesla, Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Houdini, Tin Pan Alley, the birth of film and Madison Square Garden is just a brief list of the significance of the area. ŒæI'm really drawn to the history of New York City, I find NYC such a unique location and the cross over city towards the modern world.There's a big shift in the appreciation of old New York, sadly we've lost some major structures but many businesses today are renovating the gloriousŒæbuildingsŒæthat still stand tall. ŒæFolks are curious about the past more then ever and I have always found people so curious about the stories behind my art. ŒæI really enjoy telling my tales and hearing what others have to say. it's quite a joy to have an occupation that can engage fans and supporters soŒæpassionately. ŒæMy three-step plan in becoming a emerging New York ArtistŒæFirst of all, I need to get my work noticed more and get it seen by the masses. ŒæI love feedback and finding out what works and what doesn't. ŒæSecondIy, I plan on selling my works to moreŒæprominent venues and customers. ŒæThere has never been so many opportunities as today to be seen by not only local or national but an international market of fans and buyers. ŒæIt's truly unheard of. ŒæAndŒæfinallyŒæmy dream is selling my works around the world and opening my own gallery in New York to showcase large pieces of my art. ŒæI love big and bold art works.ŒæŒæNew York is a iconic city of power and might. I want to parade that sentiment with my illustrations that remind those of a past of towering structures. ŒæThe dream is more possible today then ever before. With modern technologicalŒæinnovations I can independently sell my work around the world. ŒæIt's such a thrilling prospect and too exciting not to try and see where the journey takes me. I have already had quite a bit of success. Although I have been illustrating for well over 20 years, I've only recentlyŒæpursuedŒæit professionally. The response was so overwhelmingly great that I sometimes find it hard to believe. ŒæMy art is very well received. ŒæI have sold my art pieces at CB2, BoConcept, FAB.com and in April 2013 I will be selling at the MoMA Store. ŒæI can't tell you theŒæexuberantŒæfeeling I have when I ponder theŒæpossibilityŒæof doing what I love as a career. Œæwww.erosner.com"
1255," This project is about one thing; capturing the artistic imagery of an amazingly beautiful mustache. ŒæIt's fairly obvious that everyone loves Movember and all the great, awkward mustaches that are grown for a great cause. ŒæWhy not continue this and support the legendary Ford H. and his quest toŒæcinematicallyŒæcapture the greatest mustache in the world. ŒæOk, greatest mustache in the world might be a stretch, but believe me when I tell you that this mustache will be...wait for it...legendary.Before we get into the details of the mustache, I wanted to give everyone a better understand of who Ford is as a person. ŒæSome people are probably thinking they can't trust a guy with a name that is really two last names, but trust me when I tell you this, you can.Ford grew up in the sleepy suburbs of Seattle, Washington where he now resides with his lovely girlfriend of 10 years who is in no way concerned about getting married. ŒæAs a young boy Ford developed a strong hatred for hair and eventually ended up shaving his head. ŒæHe still hates hair andŒæhas managed to keep the same hair style for over 20 years!Œæ Ford was also quite the athlete inŒæhigh schoolŒæand eventually earned a full athleticŒæscholarshipŒæto North Central Eastern Washington University Campus of theŒæCommonwealthŒæCollege. ŒæFord now works as a business development manager (fancy term for sales) but his real passions are working out andŒæcheerleading PAC-12 sports teams.Now that you understand a little more about Ford as a person, it's time to get back to more details on the project. ŒæAs you now know, the main purpose of this project is to capture beautiful images of Ford and his mustache. ŒæYour various contributions will help in the cultivation and capture of Ford's mustache and will provide you with enjoyment for years to come.Œæ We have not settled on a final mustache type and will likely be polling our backers to pick the winning type.Œæ Ford believes that it will take 30 days to grow his mustache so please be patient with him while this happens. ŒæWe will keep people up to date on the progress and share several preliminaryŒæpictures so that all of our contributors can see how things are coming along.Thank you for your support and contributions!"
1256, I am currently in the process of writing a combination steam punk/fantasy novel.Œæ I have been coordinating with the artist for the cover illustration and she and I have decided to do a collaborative effort as far as funding goes.Œæ Her artwork speaks for itself and anyone who enjoys this genre would be more than happy to have a print of her work on their wall. The image shown here is a piece she has done previously and is meant to serve as an example of her skill.Œæ The illustration will be a scene from the illustration depicting the post apocalyptic world and one or more of the major characters.
1257," If you ever pondered the speed and agility of Frederick Douglass verses the Pizza Prowess of Herman Cain then this is the game for you!!!The game is a collectable trading card game that highlights the antics of black Republicans. The game has 15 total cards. There are  10 modern Black Republicans and 5 rare signed and numbered  limited edition silk screened cards of O.G (Original GOP) Historical Black Republicans.  The game showcases their views by pitting each Republican against each other in a race to win a (minor) speaking engagement at The RNC.This Kickstarter will fund printing of trading cards and packages, game pieces, die,  game boxes and posters of the board. It will also fund a portion of the silk screen printing cost.Forget process tin foil or silly stickers each pack comes with 10 standard trading cards cards and 1 limited edition signed and numbered silk screen card. That's right, Œæhand pulled by me in a sweat shop in NH. ŒæEach card (15 total) has a little token (no pun intended) on the back (ok just a little pun) . The tokens are the Republican Jesus: the Fish, a Wingnut: speaks for itself, Establishment GOP: --~cough~ GOP Symbol, Tea Bags er....Tea Party and an Elephant OG's Orignal GOP seen top right corner of the Douglass Card. ŒæFun Facts include biographical details, historical information, some information detailing what offices he or she held, causes they believe in or stupidity they have aspired to. For Instance did you know that Clarence Thomas may or may not watch porn? ŒæSee Below for more information on Character Tokens.Each Game Box will contain a complete game set including everything needed for 4 players to get started. The Game is for two to four players ( I guess a lonely person could play by themselves). ŒæIt is a race to a minor (~not-in-primetime~) speaking engagement at the Republican National Convention. Each Token (again no pun) corresponds to places on the board. For Instance if you are a Wingnut and land on Obama's Birth Certificate you have to go back 3 spaces . The OG's (Original GOP) have little to no contradictions so they are unaffected by the board. Herman Cain is the only card that can win the game automatically by landing on Free Pizza.ŒæOn the back of the board is a Black GOP game logo (seen above) . Each pack will also include one special silk-screened, limited edition card of one of the Five OG's: Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T Washington and Blanche Bruce. Rewards for this project include original art and additional limited addition silkscreen posters of the gameboard, the GOP Pick Poster and complete silk screen sets of all the cards. ŒæWith your support I will be able to create a complete and hilarious game that will delight and enjoy anyone with a passing interest in history and politics. Thank you in advance for your support.Œæ"
1258," My name is Andrew Nicholls and I am an artist living in the UK. I am 49, married with two boys and an elderly springer spaniel dog. As an artist I paint mainly miniature art for dolls house enthusiasts - check out my web site - however I started out many years ago drawing cartoons. Doodling over Christmas I eventually drew a cartoon self-portrait and thought ""why not take this a little bit further?My sons have a 'Where's Wally' book and this got me thinking. Why not draw a 'Where's wally' style poster but with using REAL people. After a bit of thinking I came up with the 'Find Yourself' project and looking around the Internet Kickstarter seemed a good place to pitch the idea.If you are not sure about 'Where's Wally' check him out here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3FI will draw your cartoon portrait - you get sent the original (this is a 7 x 5 inch cartoon portrait, all coloured in and ready to frame) if you pledge Œ£12 or more - and then I will use this portrait as the basis for your character in the 'Find Yourself' poster. This poster by the way, will be drawn in black and white and at the present time it will be an A3 size poster with the characters face being around an inch in size. You will appear in the poster along with everyone else and if you want me to have your character doing something specific, a hobby, a particular job, an ambition etc. then I can do this as well. I will not however draw anything that is offensive or that others may find offensive.All I need you to do is to send through a digital image of yourself - and family/friends if going for the larger rewards - and I will draw, ink in, and then paint your cartoon portrait. The finished cartoon will hopefully bear some resemblance to the person and to this end it can often take ten or more attempts until I am happy, but hey, thats my problem. Ideally I need at least 120 people to take part, this will make an A3 sized poster which will be very busy and give you a challenge to try and find yourself.Please note. If you are reading this for the second time you will notice that I have changed the 'poster' size from A4 to A3. After speaking to a number of friends and asking and taking advice, A4 was decided to be too small, and too mean. For this reason I have upped the size of the poster to A3. The reason A4 was chosen initially was to allow the 'poster' to be busy and full. however on reflection this size was a little mean and so the main poster will now be A3 size. I have changed the size in most of the copy, however in the Œ£18 reward I am unable to change the size due to having a backer, but be assured that the finished 'Find Yourself' poster will be A3 size, of course if I get 100's of backers then this may well increase. A3 size is approximately 298 x 410 mm or just under 12 x 16 inches.For certain rewards you will also get a 'Class of Find Yourself' 2013, this is where the coloured in portraits of people taking part are composed in a school style picture as shown below. The 'Class of Find Yourself 2013' will be A4 size unless the take up is so large that a bigger size is required.If you are pledging money for the Œ£18 reward and above, where more than one cartoon is offered, this is for two (or more) SEPERATE cartoon portraits. Ideal for family or friends. If I reach and exceed my target funding then I have some great extra rewards in mind, including publishing a book about the project, new posters with diiferent settings and other items that have your cartoon portrait on. More deatails to follow if and when the funding gets there.Answers to some questions you may have.What if I don't like my cartoon?I am not out to offend anyone, but it is a cartoon, so certain features may be exaggerated, however if want to make sure that the cartoon is acceptable then you can opt to have a preview of the portrait.What will happen to the image that I send you?The image that you send will only be used to produce a cartoon and as the basis for your character, once the project is completed these will be deleted from my pc.What should the image be like?Ideally the image should show your body as well as your face, I would need to get an approximation of your body shape for your character.What do you mean when you say the character can be doing anything?Well if you have always wanted to be a lumberjack, for example, I can draw your character doing some lumberjacking, always wanted to hold a snake, I can draw you holding snake etc.A4 is quite small, I am paying out a lot of money for basically an A4 size bit of paper. Please note that A3 is now the basic size of the 'Find Yourself' poster. See the note above in bold.A4 is quite small, however to make the 'Find Yourself' poster work the poster needs to be 'busy' in order to give you a challenge. "
1259," The Art by Lew project is for a Kindle book for the Amazon marketplace. This digital book will be packed with over two hundred pages of works of art by my late father, Lewis E. Wilgus Jr. This will be a way to say thank you to my parents for their hard work in raising us three boys. We were never wealthy but dad could always sell artwork to keep us ahead of the bills. This is not a feel sorry for me project but a chance to be part of giving the world a look at an artist that never received the spotlight he deserved, it just wasn't his way.The book will allow users to copy and or save the pictures with its pages to use as wall papers or any thing they would like to use the artwork for. If this is allowable through Amazons terms. A special thanks page will be listed to all those who help me fund the project with their names, and those who fund with the large amount will include a link to the offer or book of there choice. When this book hits the market this will be a valuable feature that can drive a lot of traffic to the links inside. A sample of just a few works that will be included are on my fan page I set up for some of his art. Dads Art check out the kind of work you will be helping get in front of the world. The funding will be used for getting the book professionally set up and marketing to get the book a jump start in the marketplace. So if you are able to help thank you in advance and thanks to all just for stopping by.Chad A. Wilgus"

1261," All images are the sole property of Christine Anderson and may not be reproduced in any manner.MY PLUSH ALPHABET WALL ART CARDSThank you so much for checking out my project. I am hoping with your support to have each beautiful illustration of the 26 letters of the alphabet made intoŒæ 8""x10"" heavy stock cards with rounded edges. The set of 26 cards will then be packaged in a decorative box to protect the cards when they are not being played with or displayed. I have worked very long and hard to make each letter an individual piece of art suitable for displaying either on a shelf, strung by a cord or even framed for decorative purposes as well as learning.Please help me bring these to life. AND they will be ready just in time for the holidays!I have been an artist my whole life. While receiving my degree in Graphic Design and minor in Illustration you would find me drawing still life's of stuffed animals and old toys while others were drawing skulls and other ""dark"" imagery.I have always been ""drawn"" to all things stuffed, happy and warm. Because I have an intense love of fabric (which I believe I inherited from my grandmother) , but dislike of sewing, I find the greatest pleasure in rendering it. These illustrations were all made using colored pencils on clayboard. I particularly like the hard lead pencils so I can get very detailed and capture the textures and movement of the fabric.The images created for each letter are meant to feel soft and cuddly and the patterns and textures to feel happy and warm. I hope that you will agree.REWARDSThe right side of the page lists the awesome rewards you will receive by supporting me get this project to the printer .Please find the one that is best for you. ANY support is truly appreciated. The set of cards are at a special Kickstarter price for my supporters here and include shipping right to your door (in the U.S, extra for international). They will arrive in a beautiful box for storing when you aren't playing with or displaying them to be saved and shared with future generations. Keep in mind, too, that the price is less than $1.50 per card, or PER PIECE OF ART! You can't beat that. They should also arrive just in time for the holidays so please consider them as a gift for someone else as well.The following are a few images of the original pieces that are available at the $375 level. Every letter is available , these are just a few examples. They are the letter and image drawings without the border design.MOST IMPORTANT !!I need to raise ALL $7,500. Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform. If I don't reach my funding goal, the cards don't get made and everyone will be sad. So, PLEASE spread the word, share with friends and let's get these cards into your hands!MOST MOST IMPORTANT !!!Thank you! Thank you! Thank you in advance for your support. I literally can't do this with out you and the wonderful community of Kickstarter.A very special thank you to Lesley Roman, and to my mother, my biggest supporter of all!PLEASE feel free to contact me with any and all questions. You can check out my website, www.freshpaintstudioinc.com, to see more examples of my work. I also have a facebook page called Fresh Paint Studio you can visit."

OK, the creativityŒædidn'tŒæstart flowing until after we decided on a company name).What have you done so far, and why do you need funding?Out of our own pockets we have already completed the research to find interesting events from fiction, designed the calendar and printed a test run.However, we lack the funds to print a sizeable batch, so we are looking for support to help publish the first run of the äóìThis Day in Fictionäó calendar.To help generate interest in this project we have also setup Twitter and Facebook accounts which are updated regularly with samples of the kind of thing you'd expect to see on the calendar:https://twitter.com/2dayinfictionhttps://www.facebook.com/ThisDayInFictionSo what do I get out of it?In addition to having our eternal gratitude for helping us take this first step, depending on the tier you can also receive a special Kickstarter Backer edition of the calendar and a mention on a special thank you page.If you really, really love us (ie. donate a lot of money to this cause) then you can choose a special event from your life to go on the Kickstarter Backer edition of the calendar!The pledge amount is more than you would normally expect to pay for a normal calendar; the reason for this amount is that your pledge helps cover the costs of not only producing your calendar but also the VAT, Kickstarter fees and shipping costs.What's left over we intend to use to fulfill our dreams of getting the calendar into a retail store.ApparentlyŒæyou can't put a price on dreams, but we're willing to give it a go and price ours atŒ£10a pop.So tell me more about the calendar.For each month we have scoured various sources to find accurate and interesting events that happened in fiction which correspond to real dates.From the day Jake Sully first arrives on Pandora (Avatar) to the day Oceanic flight 815 starts it's ill fated journey (Lost), we have many fictional events from films, novels, comics and video games.The calendar will include events from Red Dwarf (TV), Watchmen (comic),ŒæThe ŒæMote in God's Eye (novel), Clerks 2 (film), Alias (TV),ŒæShenmue (video game),ŒæThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (novel) and many more!Finally we'd really like to thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you'll love this idea as much as we do to consider backing us.- Stephen, Yohanseh and Gopi"

ŒæMy drawings will show tiny images, 3D, overlapping, black and white, color, everything a computer generated image can show and much, much more. ŒæI will design a book that is catered to massage therapists, physical therapists, chiropractors, dancers and people that do yoga. ŒæMy drawings will show more images and better angles than most anatomical books that are in existence now. ŒæI will also be designing posters for offices and studios. ŒæMy goal is to produce this book in the 60 days I have here on Kickstarter.

1275," A few years ago I started collecting old illustrated books because the pictures were so awesome. Most of them were published during the era of Sherlock Holmes and Alice in Wonderland, when the world was a very different place -- an amazing medieval Steampunk fantasy kind of place, if you can imagine that.ŒæThe more time I spent looking at the pictures, the more I wanted to write new stories and collaborate with artists who worked long ago -- artists like L Leslie Brooks, William Makepeace Thackeray, JM Conde, Howard Pyle, and John Tenniel.ŒæModern technology actually makes that possible. Last winter I started making digital collages using scans of those antique illustrations. The result is a collection of new characters -- characters in peril, characters search of love, characters ready for new stories -- stories you can tell, stories you can write.ŒæThis is a design phase project, not a mass-production project. The original idea was to do 100 designs for 3 x 5 cards for theŒæPERILS GALORE!ŒæBard Versus BardŒægame. Designs for 30 characters have been completed. ŒæThe first 30 designs took three months working full time, plus an investment of over $2500 in paper and ink, external drives for file storage, and book purchases.ŒæThe Kickstarter project goal will produce rewards for supporters and help fund creation of the next 30 designs by making it possible to get more cool old books and supplies for printing proofs and prototypes, upgrade equipment, get space 'on the cloud' for file backup. Additional $$ will make more equipment upgrades possible and pay for my time.ALSO -- feedback by Kickstarter supporters will help clarify priorities for the future development -- what kinds of stuff do Writers & Storytellers need? Little bitty trading cards? Biggish cards? Greeting cards? A game?  Impressive prints to put on the wall? Booklets with blank / lined pages for handwritten stories? Coffee mugs? iPad and iPhone apps?What is digital collage? Here is a simplified overview of the process, starting with an illustration from a history book published in the 1890s.ŒæStep 1. Make a high resolution full color scan of a figure with a cool costume.Step 2. Separate the character from the background and convert from color to black & white.Step 3. Adjust the limbs and posture, and start work on the new face.Step 4. Complete the new face and costume adjustments.Step 5. Add new props and colors.ŒæPrint it small [2.5 x 3.5 inches] and big [9 x 15 inches] to make sure the collage always looks great. Make adjustments and print again until all is good.Step 6. Add a new backdrop, and voila! -- this fabulous character is ready to star in a new story! Your story!Can you imagine the life and perils of this character? What brought him to this situation? Where is he going? What happens next? Will he ever achieve his goal?This is the first edition of the PERILS GALORE! images. It will only be available via Kickstarter.ŒæMy current fabrication process for trading cards and game cards = sheets of 10 cards are printed one side at a time, at 600 dpi on an Epson digital printer. It takes half an hour to print each side. The sheets are then individually cut and trimmed by me using a guillotine paper cutter. Then I snip the corners of each card with a Fiskars hand punch. It's a slow process.ŒæWhy scan your own books when you can just grab some images off the web or get one of those disks with a thousand pictures on it?The quality of images on the web and on disks are not adequate for this project. Those image are generally encumbered with copyright issues.ŒæBy scanning books of my own, I can maximize the image quality and resolution. Plus, I only use illustrations that were published before 1923, soŒæthe only copyrights are mine.Will these characters & images appear in other formats and future editions? ŒæEventually if all goes well, yes. Kickstarter supporters will be the first to know the details of that. They might also be offered the chance to play with and evaluate prototypes.ŒæHow will everyone know Kickstarter supporters have the FIRST edition and not a later one?ŒæBy a combination of the colors, the paper, the numbers and dates on signed items, the thank you postcard, plus you will be listed as a supporter on the Kickstarter PERILS GALORE!Œæproject page.Œæ"

1281," Kinda Sketchy will feature my sketch work from over the years. It's a tribute to both the start of my artistic endeavors and the rocky path I've traveled to get to this point in my life. And, while a lot of it, will be sketch work, I also plan to include some of my general art. My Art, in general? I'm new, can you tell? I also consider myself something of a lyricist. No one's ever told me I was. I have never been published or credited with a track, Nor have I collaborated on the engineering of a song or, even sat-in on a recording... But, I will.I've emptied pens into notebooks over the years and have always considered myself something of a poet. I looked up the definition of a lyricist one day and said ""WERD, I guess [I'm] also something of a lyricist"".I'm not waiting around for the world to say I'm an Artist, a Lyricist or a Poet. I open my eyes in the morning and I get busy living, like today was the last. And as such, I draw, I write, I tap out beats and hum out lyrics, on an almost constant basis, purely cause I enjoy it.That being said; I should be making my first song before ""Kinda Sketchy"" is sent to the printer and if completed, I plan to include a link to a digital download as part of the book as well. The song's title is ""Jenny"" and if I had to describe the style, I'd say it will be something along the lines of Punk/Ska and Heavy Rock.I'll be including some of my photography too. So the book won't just be sketches, but as I stated, some of my general art will be in the pages as well.With the funds collected, I'll use the proceeds to obtain the copyrights to the book, get the book produced and deliver the copies I've promised to my backers. Beyond producing the book and fulfilling my obligations to the backers, I don't really see myself trying to commercialize this work. I mainly would like to work on establishing a name for myself as a credible Artist. Some of my art pours out, while others are mapped or planned, but they all are INDEED originals and my own. It's also always been a dream of mine to be published and with your help, I could make it a reality. "

ŒæI have set-up a range of rewards for varying levels of donations. ŒæRewards range from hand-signed photographs, to actual works of art, to entire portfolios of artwork/photographs, as well as sculptural works of art.

Once the image is carved or scratched into the matrix, the top is covered with an ink and then transferred to another source, usually paper or canvas ŒæŒæFor those who do not frequent Kickstarter, it works on an all-or-nothing basis, so if all the funds are not raised, the entire project must be scrapped. ŒæI would love to avoid this at all costs, so if anyone has an idea for a different reward, just let me know."

I will share my knowledgs of letterpress, screen and relief printing through this mobile art studio. The public will be invited to enter the Art Lab and create and print their own letterpress poster, card, or screen print a t-shirt. I love to teach and have always had a desire to share letterpress, screen, and other forms of printmaking with others. Living in a rural area it is difficult for people to come to me, so I put together the idea of taking the Art Lab to the people. I plan on participating in community event and setting up events with local collages and high schools to introduce people to world of printmaking.To make things easier I will put together handouts so people can save the time and hassle of sourcing resources to get their projects started. I will share the tips and trick that took me years to learn on my own like:1. Where to find leads on equipment and where to buy supplies2. How the equipment works and what their capabilities are3. How to print4. How to create your own exposure light source for letterpress plate creation and screen burningŒæ5.

The mobile studio will have a select amount of wood type and lock-up materials for doing hands on, type setting demonstration for cards and posters. Demonstration of printing invitations, business cards and posters would be the main focus on this machine. ŒæA standard 4 color screen printing station would be deconstructed and welded into the van so that shirts and posters could still be printed in proper registration. A 110V flash dryer would be the heat set unit for t-shirts and a drying rack for posters would be incorporated into the van also. Everything from multi-colored 11äó x 17äó poster to t-shirts would be possible in the mobile studio.A standard 110 and 30amp RV hookup would be incorporated into the studios design to run machines, lights, possible RV air conditioner and single shirt flash dryer.ŒæTHE MONEYThe money raised through Kickstarter will go to the purchase of the 1954 Fageol van, and some of it's modifications and repairs. Modifications would include wall mounting the screen printing equipment and building cabinets. Any additional items needed for the van will come out of my pocket, unless there is an overage of funding, which would make me ridiculously overjoyed, to get The Art Lab on the road sooner.THE OUTLOOKOnce the Art Lab is complete I plan on doing demos and workshops at colleges, art fairs and community events in my immediate location of Southwest Missouri and then branching out to cities within a six to eight hour radius like Kansas City, St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Memphis, Wichita and everywhere inbetween. From there I would like to take things National and bring the Art Lab to cities across the United States.THE REWARDSCheck the right side. I am going to be cutting a bunch of linoleum to do some sweet posters and also designing up t-shirts too!"
1287," This calendar is the culmination of years of artistic study and vision coming together. I have finally been able to bring cohesion to my vision and style in these calendar pictures. So far,Œæ9 of the 12 months have a pin-up drawing. I am currently working on theŒæremaining 3Œæand the cover pictures as well. I am planning to release the calendar for the holiday season 2012, so this fundraiser is running pretty quickly. I just need a little help to make this happen, and great gifts are availableŒæfor supporters!Where will the money be going? This is a great question. The funds raised for this project will be used exclusively for the printing of the calendar and advertising. I have invested in the art for the calendar already, but a bit of assistance is needed to bring this project to completion. Once the calendar is printed, it will be made available for purchase inŒæMichiganŒæat local bookstores, local art galleries,Œæand online atŒæEtsy and Red Bubble. Thank you for your interest in this project. It means the world to me, and I am hopeful that it will find the support it needs here on Kickstarter."
1288," OK this project is a lifetime dream that I'm trying to make happen. ŒæI've always been interested in drawing in the Japanese anime/manga style and have always wanted to create my own manga (even though I'm clearly not Japanese). ŒæFor those of you who don't know, a manga is a Japanese-styled comic book that is characterized by pretty artwork and characters drawn in a sort of caricatured form, typically with over-exaggerated eyes. ŒæIn comparison to American comics (ie- DC and Marvel), they tend to be far less detailed but still maintain the appearance of the character. ŒæNow I know you're wondering why I'm trying to raise $800, right? Well self-publishing for @ least 10 books is not cheap, plus I need to get some new supplies for actually drawing out my manga and my characters. ŒæI intend, for my first book, to make it a collection of 3 or 4 one-shots (or short stories) and then I'll take a poll on myŒæDeviantArt:Œæidraw91.deviantart.comŒæon which one the readers like best; the one with the most votes is the one I will continue working with.I plan to do all this by using on online publishing website to create 10 copies of my book. ŒæThen, I'll contact bigger publishers like Oni Press and DC and try to sell them on my book. ŒæWith their help, I'll finally be able to produce my manga and continue working with my art!! ŒæHowever.... If I am not successful in raising funds by the end of the 60 days, I will just have to resort to uploading pages online and will probably never be able to get it published..."

By donating here, you are funding a new media for the designs I so much love to create; tee shirts!ŒæDepending on your donation, you can get one of these limited edition prints of famous pop-culture icons seen frequently today. $50 can even get you a hand-sketched work of art. All of the money goes towards printing costs to get this started, and will hopefully later kickstart an education in the world of concept art and design. Your consideration is much appreciated :)"

1291," Hi, I'm Xavius, I'm an artist currently serving in the Armed Forces. ŒæI've just became a father and recently married my soulmate. ŒæI've been using a style of art called ""Micrography"" for some time now. ŒæIt's a style in which you use words to create an image. ŒæI've created several images of musicians using their lyrics. ŒæI've also been commissioned to recreate pictures for people using words of their choosing.For this project, I recreated the Twin Towers using the names of the victims. This is a dedication, a memorial of sorts, for the innocent people who lost their lives on 911. ŒæI complied a list of the victims and used it to rebuild the towers. ŒæI created this over a 7 day period with about 25 hours. ŒæI need copies of my micrographies for galleries and retail. ŒæYour contribution will help with the materials and production for these works of arts. ŒæYou also will get a copy of the Twin Towers and a customized micrography, depending on your fund level.

1294," The 'Out of the Nest' project started out in january of 2012, as a group of paintings for cards, at the request of a local bookstore. I soon realized that I had no cost effective way of getting them printed but that didn't stop me, I just kept going-posting the progression of each painting to my friends. They literally watched the paintings come alive, offering me encouragement and suggestions every step of the way (and they hated when I recycled a painting I thought was not good enough) I am so grateful to them allI included some of that progression in the video as well as on the blog for this project so you folks too can see some of the paintings from start to finishhttp://outofthenestcardproject.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-beginnings.htmlI also included some glimpses into my studio, as well as a few other things i'm working on.ŒæŒæIn august I  discovered kickstarter,  and realized that with help from other people, I could get my cards printed!WHY 'out of the nest' ?I named this project out of the nest because on so many levels this has meaning for me -Œæobviously it's nests and birds. ŒæŒæBut in addition it is the first really large scale project I have ever done by myself.To me it is so exciting to know that with your help, my birds and their nests will be going out into the world. That one person will perhaps send a card to another person, and in a way my images will have a life of their own. Truly out of their nestSo what is this project?ŒæŒæ It is  12 of my finished paintings that will become card sets with envelopes, 6 are birds, 6 are birds nests with eggs.They will be professionally scanned, which takes 3 days, then printed on 5'' x 7'' mat card stock, ... you can use them as greeting cards or frame them as small printsThe scanning alone is very expensive as it is being done by drum scanner, I've tried to scan them myself but the color is not as nice as the originals. BeingŒæProfessionallyŒæscanned insures that the quality of the finished cards as well as any fine art prints will be the best that technology can offer today, and the color will match the originals exactly.The cards, 500 of each of the 12 paintings, are being printed in four color offset prints which takes 3 weeks as plates are made of each of the four colors used for a total of 48 plates. Each color is printed separately, then when printed and dried, the cardstock is cut and scored. Why 500 of each image? The 500 amount is the most cost effective way of getting this project done, allowing me to offer these cards at a good price.If this project goes over my funding goal, there is a 13th painting of a fledgling bird about to leave the nest (that's it at the end of the video) Œæthat can also be printed as cards, and depending on how much funding this project gets,  the other paintings can also be printed as fine art museum quality prints ready to mat and frame, these will be larger then the original 5x7 paintings. Another possibility is tote bags.Now kickstarter only works if a project is fully funded, you can go OVER your goal but nothing happens if you don't reach your goal - so i am hoping that you folks will join me in getting these paintings out into the world. Just launching this project was a project in itself,  first, i was determined to use a local printer, to hopefully do my part in helping american jobs. it took a while but i did finally find one willing to take this onŒæ i had  16 paintings all together which i narrowed down to 12, as i felt that would be a good number. I also found a local company that was able to do the fine art scanning! THAT was a  miracle as every other time i had looked for one, the closest one was 150 miles away!ŒæThe making of the 'video' was interesting, as I don't have access to a camcorder, so I just used the photos that I posted to my friends as the paintings were being done. I used the mic on the laptop, and some really simple editing equipment. ŒæIt took me a while to figure it all out too. I can laugh about it now.Œæ Now about the rewards, äó_.well the rewards for backing this project are the cards themselves!ŒæI have them listed on the right there. Every level of backing gets cards!ŒæI expect to ship mid november, just in time for the holidays!ŒæIf you like this project but for whatever reason, are unable to back this, please spread the word about it.ŒæThank you so much for taking the time to look this project over with me. And I hope together we can make this happenMUSIC 'Haunting' by Jamie Evans - Thank you so much Mr Evans for permission to use this beautiful music. Œæ Œæ Œæhttp://jamieevansmusic.com/Œæ"

1296," For the past twenty years I have been reinventing the tarot. Oh, hi, by the way; I am Dusty White, author of over a dozen books, includingŒæThe Easiest Way to Learn the Tarot--EVER!!, and my newest books:ŒæŒæAdvanced Tarot Secrets,ŒæThe Easiest Way to Learn Astrology--EVER!!,Œæand Aphrodite's Book of Secrets.ŒæThis deck is a labor of love I began back in 1992. It is the world's first true blending of astrology and the tarot. I need your help to pay for the art. I hope you will grant me a few moments to explain why this will change your life forever . . .* Video testimonial for the new deck **First reviews of the deck:""Dusty,Thank you so much for creating the Ouroboros Deck. I have tried to learn Astrology from countless books and nothing ever stuck. I could remember a few things about the husband and kids, but I could never figure out other peoples signs or personality. Combining learning Astrology with the artwork in the Ouroboros has made every sign and planet commit to memory and stick.ŒæEverything makes sense and can be applied.. Why do the husband and son fight for my attention? Both have Moon in Libra. It is also easier to deal with coworkers. As you grit your teeth and wait for the supervisor's slow labored reasoning to actually get to the point you understood 10 minutes back, smile they have Mercury in Taurus. I love the fact that I am not having to constantly looking everything up in a book. Once you learn it, the big picture flows.ŒæThe cards have also been a wonderful tool for manifesting. I used Aries Moon to muster up some ""Damn-it, I'm Worth It"" confidence. In the process I have found more time for myself (even with the kids home for the summer) and I've lost 9 pounds. Because ,oh yes, this fiery gypsy is Worth It!ŒæI can't wait to use the cards for tarot spreads. The Ouroboros Deck can open up a new level of understanding for me. Timing, understanding personalities, and underlying issues will be so much easier to get out of the spread. The levels of symbolism and the stories within the deck itself make it the perfect evolution of the tarot.ŒæThanks again for your vision and gift to the world on this Dusty. I have enjoyed every minute of class and your guidance in Astrology and the Ouroboros Deck is already opening up more of the world to me.""--Becka GalloŒæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ . . . Œæhere's one more Œæ. . .""I took the class on the new Astro deck and was really glad I did. I have always been interested in astrology and I have studied the tarot for years. I was ready for a challenge. I had read Dustyäó»s book , äóìThe Easiest Way to Learn TarotäóîEver!!äó. I knew I liked his style.When Dusty teaches he gives everything he has to his students, time and availability being the two most things. He makes himself available for questions through email. Put simply, he loves teaching and sharing his knowledge. He takes the time to make sure his students understand. He lets them know that questions are welcome.Taking the Astro Tarot class was fun! Dusty teaches in a way that is far from boring. He engages his students and expects good things from them. He makes his students want to please him. I will not lie. As students we have to come prepared to learn. We have to be prepared for class. And he makes it safe to learn and make mistakes. I made plenty of mistakes and he never became angry with me. He was patient and knew I was trying.What did I learn? What didnäó»t I learn? I learned I am a triple cancer and that means having 3 planets in my sun sign. That makes me very emotional and filled with feeling. I can be a little moody and my chart confirms it. I have always been very verbal when I see an injustice. I say what is on my mind and have trouble filtering it. It took me years to actually start trying to use diplomacy. What is some of the reason for that? I have Moon in Aries. That is also why I HAVE to say something if I see a dog in a car left alone. My chart explains so much of who I am. Dustyäó» and his class helped me understand myself better.I will take every class Dusty has to offer me whenever possible. As I said, his classes are not boring and that makes me very happy. It is not just a lecture class which I would hate. If you really want to learn something and want it taught in an interesting way take a class given by Dusty White.""--Helen Oäó»Bannonhttp://byHelenJewelry.etsy.comŒæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ Œæ. . .  okay, ONE more, but this is it! . . .""I think the most amazing thing about Dusty Whiteäó»s Astro Deck is the pictures. They are incredibly accurate. I was able to take the cards that represent the planets and signs in my chart and literally see my life in the images. Studying this deck with Dusty means Iäó»ve gotten used to one mind blowing moment after another!The best thing is that this deck is for anybody and everybody, whether or not youäó»ve ever studied astrology or the tarot before. If youäó»ve studied astrology before and think you understand it äóñ this deck and the insights and information Dusty will teach you in the workbook will take your understanding to a whole new level. And if youäó»ve been frustrated with the tarot because the meanings of the cards can be confusing and limited, this deck will change all of that for you. I know it has for me!  This deck encompasses the best of both worlds of astrology and tarot and lets you discern the future, meditate, understand others, get what you want out of life, you name it, like no other deck that has ever existed before.  Iäó»ve studied astrology and tarot for years and Iäó»ve never seen anything like it.  This deck, unlike a traditional tarot deck, leaves NOTHING out. Like Dusty says, astrology is the understanding of how every kind of energy in the universe works. The images are bursting with easy to understand symbolism and cover every aspect of astrology äóñ signs, planets, elements, qualities, polarities äó_ in incredibly beautiful, stunning scenes that are simple to remember and interpret. These cards  are a world unto themselves. They open up this world here on Planet Earth and explain your place and purpose in it in a simply profound way. Dusty has poured his heart and soul and deep knowledge of astrology  into this deck, and it shows in every breathtaking card."" ŒæŒæ--Col.ŒæCarol Powers USAFOther student testimonials **appear below** as well.So, if you have gotten this far you might want a little more information on exactly what these books are . . .This is the best-reviewed tarot book in Amazon history. Even the Golden Dawn states that there is no better book for the beginner. (I am blushing--really). I am very proud that this book helps people who feel they cannot learn the tarot after they have read countless books. I know this--they tell me (almost) every day. It is 345 pages of tarot workbook (8x10). The thing weighs almost two pounds.ŒæThis book is unique and contains everything but a pencil and an actual deck of cards to play with.This is my baby. Everything I wish someone would have whispered in my ear 35 years ago when I first picked up a deck of cards and an instruction book will be in here. The book is being written right now and will be out by spring, Christmas if we get funded. This book will contain all of the knowledge I have gained from 20 years of teaching the tarot, decades of reading tarot professionally, and the unique experience of working in-person with over 400 of the world's top psychics on a daily basis for several years. (Oh, I picked their brains clean!) Nothing is held back--and there will be no parlor tricks to impress your clients and no faux tarot history or artificially added systems to confuse you or make me look mysterious and all-powerful. This is straight from the gut: how toŒægive readings that are three times more detailed than you ever have before--with the same exact cards, and how to verify spreads before you cast them, and how to never give a bad spread again, and how to manifest anything you want, and how to read the distant past and future (accurately), and how to find hidden spreads within larger spreads--and more, and more . . .ŒæThis is the next book in the series. It is so secret I am only going to show you the cover. I might offer advance copies as a stretch reward.Thanks for being here. Please ask me any questions you may have.-- Dusty White :-)Oh yeah . . . brand new testimonial (just came in and it is on file):""I LOVE this book. I just started working with it about a week ago and have accomplished more with my card reading than I have in the past few years I've owned the cards! I've left them sit on the shelf for months at a time because I was frustrated with them, now I have a hard time putting them down! Dusty does a phenomenal job in his teaching approach and takes the stress and struggle out of trying to learn and remember card meanings. It makes ""connecting the dots"" incredibly easy. I decided to purchase this book after reading a few reviews on Amazon, good and not so good, and I am NOT sorry I bought this! There is probably more information between the covers of this book that what you will find in several other tarot books combined. In addition I have viewed his website and podcasts he tells you about in the book which were also a huge help in clarifying things for me. I have also contacted Dusty via the e mail he provides for one on one help. He responded to me faster than what I expected with a lot of great information to help me. If there is only one book on reading the tarot that you should own, THIS is it!!""---AmyŒæKile"
1297," This project will consist of a small limited edition of 100 prints made from my original graphite drawing. If it is well received, there are plans to do more drawings in this genre - sporting art. The ultimate goal is to be picked up by a known publishing house, or contract with a conservation group for their fundraisers (supporting these groups is also important to me, and I have donated several carvings over the years to their causes), but for now, in order to get my work out there, I must self-publish. Hopefully, the edition will sell out, and establish a client base (including hopefully you, dear reader) and track record for my work. The subject matter is an extension of my primary art form - that of carving and painting highly realistic birds, including waterfowl.ŒæThis piece and the prints have an image size of 8""x10"" and the overall size of the print is 9""x12"". As stated earlier, it is limited to a small run of 100 prints. The subject matter is a antique-style longtail duck decoy, and is done in graphite.The prints will be made on archival quality, acid-free heavy watercolor paper, and will be printed using the black and white digital giclee' method.My current marketing plan is to sell from my website, Whispering Eagle Studio , Facebook, word-of-mouth (utilizing my existing collector and fan-base), and in galleries.ŒæThank you so much for taking the time to look at my project, and hopefully, help to build a foundation for my work."

1299," Sport In Art Series - Baseball & Football. I created a poster project in order to promote sport worldwide through the visual arts - to make a poster using an image from history - at least one hundred years old, and use at least five different languages within the design. My first poster was for the sport of WRESTLING - my own sport. The image comes from a book printed in the 16th century with the Latin word for wrestling in the lower left corner - LUCTATORES. Using four different colors I used four languages in different fonts for the word ""WRESTLING - Lutte (French), Lucha (Spanish) and Ringen (German). The printing is high quality only - I used two coats of black ink for a solid background, brilliant silver ink for the image in the center, solid blue, red, green and yellow for the languages. The image here cannot compare to the poster in a frame on your wall. This series will cover every sport you can imagine - the posters do not promote a specific team or country - just the sport itself because sport is universal. There are over 60 posters planned for the series but next on the agenda are BASEBALL and FOOTBALL (the American game). So help get this project funded and pick one of the two posters as your reward. Thanks for your help! Merci beaucoup - vielen dank - gracias - grazie - spaceba."

1301," I was on a FIRST Robotics Team for four years. Then, I graduated.Since the beginning, FIRST has been about innovation. It was about finding new ways to solve problems, to achieve more than others. Achieving this is a feat in itself, but how do we make it permanent? As a graduate, I was looking for a way I could remember these four years, a way I could show others, now and in the future, the great innovations that mere high school students made. The answer? An FRC Card Deck, featuring the greatest robots of 2012. Whether for distribution to sponsors, event judges, or team members, or merely a piece of personal memorabilia more permanent and more useful than a button, a card deck can help spread the word of FIRST, and can help you remember the best years of your life.I can ship these decks, once produced, to justŒæabout anywhere in the world. However, if you're outside the United States, you may have to pay more for shipping. "
1302," Blending together two of my life long loves - surfing and classical art - created such a wonderfully silly contradiction, that I couldn't pass up the desire to further explore these incongruous images. ŒæThus was born the idea for classic surfing. And what better way to insure that these images be seen and enjoyed by millions, than to put them on T-Shirts.Hi, this is Grace's Dad, Steve (and believe me she's way cuter than I am) . ŒæIt is our hope that through a website, we can distribute about 500 of each of these 5 designs.All of these images will have the ""Classic Surfing Logo"" near them. ŒæSo all of them will be both funny and stylish.ŒæWhile working on these designs over the last few years, we have delved into the world of silk screening, and we've found that to really do it right can be very costly.ŒæThis brings us to the last two premiums, which include the two limited edition prints. ŒæAlthough they are in the video, we wanted you to see them here as well.There are only 20 of these.There really is only one of these (we do have one that we keep in a frame). ŒæIf there is more than one person who sends in over a thousand dollars, it will have to go to the 1st person giving the largest amount, but anyone else would certainly get a print of ""Autumn's Angel"" and the rest of the stuff. ŒæPlease see the pledge section, and Œæif you would prefer the ""Autumn's Angel"" print instead, just let us know.Although I am an introvert by nature (as my Facebook page will attest), if you are interested in this project, then I am interested in you. ŒæFeel free to get in touch, and stay in touch.(By the way, our website will note that surfing, although ancient, was invented by the native peoples of the Hawaiian Islands.)"
1303," 100. It's a large number. And when you add ""illustrations"" behind it, it's a significant commitment. That is what I'm planning to do. I'm going to travel around Ireland and Northern Ireland for six weeks and capture the essence of it and the people through illustrations. One hundred of them. I will also be journaling/blogging/documenting the entire process and working on a memoir (possibly a future Kickstarter project) while I make my way around, seeing the sites, engaging the locals, and experiencing the culture...one illustration at a time.THE PROCESS:As I travel I will be taking a lot of photographs. Those photographs will eventually be the basis for the fully developed illustrations. I will post some of them to various social networking sites as I travel so that everyone can see all the best bits of my journey. I usually first work out my preliminary sketches on vellum or tracing paper (like the photo above). I find it more forgiving when I start erasing things and experimenting with what I might want the end result to be. I can be quite a perfectionist and it helps me have a more pristine original piece. Once I have something I feel will make a good illustration, I move over to a higher quality paper (unless I'm doing a digital illustration, then I take a photo or scan and get started on tracing it into the computer). I am expecting the originals to be 11""x14"" or 11""x17"" (depending on which paper I decide on) to more easily accommodate a flatbed scanner for image capturing the final pieces and so that postage costs to send pieces as rewards is reduced. These are the pieces that will be included in the official 100 illustrations. Some will be simple line drawings, some with full contrast showing a lot of elaborate detail through shading, stipple or crosshatching. I might even do some digital illustrations or scratchboard. I can't say for sure. I'm guessing that most will be graphite or pen + ink, but I don't want to limit myself for this since this will be an ongoing project eventually covering many places and I want to keep it exciting.I'll also be using Field Notes memo books to write notes in, doodle in, and collect various collage type goodness (like paper coasters, or brochures, or business cards, or napkins or...anything I can get my hands on to document every bit of this adventure). They're pocket friendly and will be easy to use walking through parks and such. Some of these will be up for grabs as rewards. The sketching and doodling I do in this manner will be casual and likely silly. I find it to be a good warm up exercise before jumping into the bigger pieces.Prints will be limited edition runs of 100 for each illustration. They will be printed by me on 11""x14"" 64lb. Aurora Fine Art Natural paper with archival ink in my studio, hand numbered and autographed.A note about delivery dates: I have no actual idea how long they will take me. It will depend largely on the ratio of simple line drawings to elaborate stipple illustrations. I don't want to rush them so for anyone expecting originals or things like that...I will keep everyone posted on the process and update timelines as things develop.Thank you for supporting this project. It means the world to me. If you're able, please pass it along to your circle of friends that love art and travel. Like it. Follow it. Tweet it. Shout it from rooftops. I'll need all the help I can get to not only accomplish this goal, but to move forward with future destinations.ŒæWhat's the money being used for?What if you make more than you need?I'll put the money toward the next project...100 Illustrations: Portland.ŒæWhere can we see more of your work?My website. Kelly Anderson Studio. You can see my portfolio, find me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, read my blog, see artists and designers I love. You'll find out tons about me and my work...probably more than you want to."

1305," My pseudonym is ScorpLion, I have been an artist for 17 years, my primary media is pen & ink. The main concept for this collection started in 2006 with a 1 page drawing (see reward section D). Four years later while I was serving in the military I thought it was time to complete what I had started and began to draw illustrations daily. I completed 157 of them while I was in the service and after the military I added 8 more drawings to this collection. This project ended with a total of 166 illustrations. All of the drawings are inked in Black and White  and the subject is a relationship between the same Boy and Girl. This was a love story which started with lots of excitement and happiness and ended years later in huge heart break. Some drawings show how happy they were, and others show how depressed and desperate the Male character was. Several of the drawings are based on daily actions between Lovers. The depressing illustrations show how love can be ridiculous, painful, and can leave you feeling like you are bleeding to death.Love For SALE is an illustrated window into a relationship with its ups and downs, bright and dark sides, pain and love that needs to open its curtain for You!Œæäó¢	If you have ever fallen in love,äó¢	If you have ever felt happiest while in love,äó¢	If you have ever felt special,äó¢	If you have ever been hurt,äó¢	If you have ever felt all aloneŒæIf you can relate to any of these then please keep readingäó_.ŒæThis project will be a mirror in your hand.

1306," This project is to capture the essence visually of the modern world that we live in and the people and places that fill it in North and South America. I feel it is very important in these times of change to visually capture the world as it is now in this era. The world is changing vastly and soon there may not be some of the natural landscapes or even people that fill it. Fortunately, as a Visual Artist I have the opportunity to create the images of North and South America and do it with a dramatic work of art that will inspire more people to see and explore the world and cherish the natural wonders and people with-in it. I would truly like to thank each of you personally who become involved in this project. Upon completion of this project I will begin work on another project to create tutorial drawing videos and if it becomes popular I will create more tutorial videos on other elements of drawing as well as painting and digital art.I have a true passion for art and I hope my drawings will reflect this for the world to see.What this funding will cover is the cost of a passport, travel expenses to and back from South America, transportation in North and South America, room and board/food, a local guide in South America, art supplies such as high quality paper, pencils and storage for transportation to South America of my art supplies, easels,  packaging and shipping for all of the ""bonus"" items for those who pledge.Here are a few more examples of my work."
1307," Hi there! Thanks for checking out my Printing project! My name is Lauren, but most people around here call me ""JerZy"" because of where I grew up before I moved to Tennessee. I live in Princeton, New Jersey for about 10 years before traveling with my parents to the beautiful foothills of Northeastern Tennessee. I love the setting I live in and it lets meŒæviewŒænature in a different respect than I could in ""the big city"".I have always loved art since a little girl. I would draw EVERYTHING I could, but my main focus was on ANIMALS. I love them and I am very passionate about animals and animal rescue. I started drawing horses, my pets, basically anything I had around me.ŒæWhen I moved away from my parents (not too far mind you, right down the road so to say) I decided to adopt a rescue English Bulldog. After much research into the breed to make sure it was a match, I decided to be a foster home for ""dog aggressive"" bulldogs, since I did not have any current dogs. We fostered a few, and I found a perfect match to me through my local rescue club ""Smokey Mountain Bulldog Rescue"" and decided to become a permanent home for a wonderful 2 year old dog named Lucy. She came to us with a few medical issues which we are treating right now. That lead me to discover that SO MANY rescue organizations are in desperate need of funds for animals that require surgery and medical attention. So many come in with horrendous problems like mange, parvo, hip issues, eye problems, skin problems and so much more. So I decided I would help as much as I could through my art! It's my way of giving back to the animals in need. I donate pet portraits which 100% of the proceeds go to these rescues. This is part of the reason I would like to make prints. I would like to be able to make copies of my work to sell andŒædonateŒæfor these rescue organizations.ŒæI also started making zombies in 2008, then in 2009 I branched out to doing custom zombie plushies as well as custom zombie artwork for all. I have been requested to make art prints of my work so that everyone can enjoy them! I work in quite a few different medias and would love to be able to share my paper and canvas works with everyone! I truly enjoy what I do and love being able to make people smile and giggle with my work. I really want this chance to share my work with everyone all over the globe and be able to help animals in need.Here are a few more examples of what I do!Here are a few of the jewelry designs I offer through my store that you will be able to choose from for rewards:Please check out my shop for more offers!!http://www.etsy.com/shop/ChewsBrainsThank you so much for considering me.

1308," I am a graphic movie poster designer and myŒæpassion is to design posters. i also love comics and comic films, so I decided to combine both my passion for posters and my love of comics as one. I had no plans for them, it was just a fun little project i did on the side. Until I posted them on face book and got a ton of likes and commentsŒæfromŒæfriends family and fans. The posters took off as you can say.after dozens and dozens of emails and messages asking where prints of the poster could be purchased, not only from fan but industry professionals i reached out toŒæmultiple print shops and website and found that the cost to get themŒæprofessionally printedŒæwas way, way out of the range of what I could afford. So I looked up Kickstarter for help.what i'm trying to do is get three of the most popular and requested poster designs printed. the hail hydra, avengers and the dark knight rises designs.they will all be screen printed at 18x24. the amount i'm asking for covers set up fee and printing cost for 250 copies of each poster designs 750 posters in all.In addition to that, it will also cover the cost of mailing. I plan to do all the packing and mailing myself.Add $5 to your donation for shipping to Canada, add $10 for the rest of the world.i am also using kickstarter as a way for anyone who'd like a poster to pre-order them.

1315," So a quick bit about me, ever since I can remember I have been fascinated and consumed by art, pop culture, cartoons, video games, and comics.I knew early on I wanted to be an artist, and for the last 15 years of my professional career to date, I am doing just that. I love doing vector basedillustrations on subject matter that is fun to me, and I have always wanted to be able to create archival prints of my art, as well as do professional qualityt-shirts and stickers of my art myself. I love a great looking decal, always tons of great places to put them, cars, laptops, skateboards, you name it!Awhile back I started doing research and found a solution that lets me do all of these things.I am looking to purchase a Roland Printer/Cutter and Hotronix Digital Heat press. With these 2 pieces of equipment I can offer professional qualityvinyl stickers, shirts, archival prints, canvas prints, banners and more. This printer cutter is pretty amazing. It uses Eco-Sol inks, which are are UVand water resistant for up to 3 years outdoors. This is an entry level professional piece of equipment, not a $100 desktop printer. I'll be ableto print decals that can go on cars, storefront windows and more that will be able to withstand the elements. This machine also contour cuts artwork.For example the stickers and shirts won't just be designs on square stickers, the blades in this machine will contour cut around the design offering a veryprofessional product.The machine will also print full color on professional grade heat transfer material, and the hottronix press will allow me to offer professional quality heat transferred shirts.Here is where I am reaching out to the kickstarter community. The good news is I have raised over half of the amount needed, but the rest is just very slow going.I am only asking for help on the rest of what I need, not the full amount.

1318," Vintage pin ups have always been a love of mine. ŒæThe concept for this project came to me whilst looking at different cosplay ideas and coming across a photo-drawing of Silk Spectre from Watchmen. ŒæOriginally, I was going to create a vintage calendar involving super heroines, but I do not believe I could secure the rights from Marvel and DC to do it. ŒæInstead, my plan to start is to make a calendar of vintage pin ups from the 1930s through about the 1960s. ŒæThis project will easily take a few weeks to complete and photographers are not inexpensive for projects such as this.The money for this project goes to paying the photographer (you get what you pay for in this department) as well as the graphic artist to professionally layout the calendar. ŒæThere are also expenses that need covered for hair and costuming, then covering the prizes for people who donate (extra prints, extra time spent shooting, etc).Thank you for stopping by my Kickstarter page. ŒæPlease remember that, unless my goal is met, you will not be charged for your donation, so go ahead and pledge. ŒæWhen my goal is met and you receive your reward, you will be very glad you did!"
1319," Want to send a special note? These are some special cards!I write icons based on Byzantine tradition. Each icon is created according to a pattern handed down through the centuries. The emphasis is not on innovation, but adherence to a spiritual tradition meant to draw the viewer closer toŒæChrist. Yet each hand painted piece is an original bathed in prayer and carrying the whisper of the one who painted it.ŒæThe process of writing an icon is slow and meditative and involves many steps. I work in egg tempera and 24K gold on natural gesso. It takes 3-4 weeks for me to create each one.ŒæMy goal is to create a series of five icons from the life of Christ. I will then have them printed onto high quality vellum note cards (envelopes included). I will include a short description of the imagery on the back. The card can easily be kept in a Bible to enhance devotional time, or sent with a personal note to someone else. Everybody needs Jesus!ŒæTo be included:The Holy FamilyChrist PantocratorJesus Casts Out the DemonsMan of SorrowsChristŒæEnthronedŒæin GloryI am asking for enough to fund my first small print run and buy needed art supplies.

Cards will be delivered in plenty of time to send out for Christmas.I would be delighted to have you be a part of my work!"
1320," Ever since I heard Dream Theater's ""Scenes From A Memory"" I've wanted to draw a graphic novel adaptation.Œæ The adaptation would be different enough to avoid copyright infringement but would still be a fan work and hopefully preserve the original feel of the album and story.I've been drawing for many years, mostly comics, and have wanted to work on a full-scale graphic novel for a very long time.Œæ However, I do my art digitally and the software I'm using barely cuts it for simplistic, cell-shaded comic pages.Œæ In the trial period that I was able to use Adobe Photoshop CS5, I've been able to draw in a way that looks much, much cleaner.Œæ Since CS6 is coming out soon, I want to jump on the ball and purchase a copy but I need a little help.I don't want to make any profit off of the graphic novels; this is a fan work dedicated to the incredible artists in the band.Œæ Therefore, the software component of my project is budgeted at $50 over the cost of the Higher Education version of CS6 Design Premium, which is $400 from Academic Superstore, including tax.Œæ I am an eligible college student, so I'm trying to get the lowest price on this software that I can without breaking the law by torrenting it.Œæ The additional $50 is to cover transaction fees and shipping for incentives.For the actual drawing, I have an HP tablet PC with good pressure sensitivity that I've been using so far in my art.Œæ It works ok now, but during the trial of CS5, the art that I made with it was phenomenally better.Œæ Again, because I feel that getting high quality, expensive, and copyright software for free is wrong, I want to try to raise money so that I can legally and properly buy the software that I need to make this graphic novel look the best that I possibly can."
1321, This is a woodblock print I've been wanting to make for a while. I will need to rent access to a printing prress and get use of inks (all of which I can easily arrange).

1325," I am trying to create a suite print. A suite print is when many artists come together and they each create an edition of prints. In this case we'll say 25 artists each making a print of 30 identical copies.One print from each artist goes into the collection. ŒæAll the same size, and all based on a theme, but each widely interpreted by many artists in their own unique styles and designs. In the end each of the artists get's their own copy of the collection, samples of their own and 24 other of their peers. The remaining five or however many collections are for display and Reward contributors.I will buy a used lithograph press, and table top rolling press for linocut, photoplate, and intaglio. I will find a suitable studio space. Then that press will be used by 25 different artists to each create a series of prints. I will buy paper and inks, drying racks, all plate and litho pencils, and will provide these materials for all artists involved to complete the work. Once the prints are completed, those lithographs are then collated, so that each of the sets of art have one piece from each artist.ŒæA full set of prints will have 25 pieces of unique and original art based upon a theme, from 25 unique emerging artists carefully selected for their differences, and for their similarities. ŒæThe theme for this series will be ""Half Empty, Half Full"". ŒæEach artist will create a print on 24x36"" archival rives BFK. However they decide to interpret the theme is up to the artist. It could be anything. It could be a literal interpretation, or a surrealist drama. It might be a political statement or a cartoon. It all depends on the artist. I will personally assure that all prints are well drawn, properly printed and consistent for each print. I will encourage color printing.At the end of the year of creating work, we will exhibit the entire collection, divide the suite print among the artists, and patrons. ŒæWe will publish a magazine which will be self printed in small batches and sold to anyone who would like to have the images, if they can't have the work itself. This will help emerging artists get exposure, publication, and interaction in a big way.This studio for one year will not only be a press. It will be a melting pot of ideas. This will be a place where creativity is born. We'll use it to make great art, and bad art, and in the end create a collection which may be a joint exhibit of some of tomorrow's greatest artists while they are young. A collection like this could even be of profound importance in the future. Bringing great artists together to suit one purpose has often yielded some of our greatest breakthroughs. The collaborations of creativity bear the sweetest fruit."
1326," The author/illustrator Tammy King never knew she would one day become an accomplished artist. ŒæIn fact, until she reached her 40's she never even tried to draw anything. ŒæHer life changed dramatically when her husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. While spending countless hours in waiting rooms of a seemingly endless array of doctors' offices, she began to doodle to relieve stress and pass the time. ŒæShe immediately received a compliment on her drawing and before long, the entire waiting room gathered around her to see her creations.After much prodding from family, friends and total strangers, Tammy has agreed to publish her illustrations. ŒæAs demonstrated in the photos above, her drawings are very simple but each one manages to convey its own unique personality. ŒæSomehow, without any artistic training whatsoever, she has been able to create these works of art that are appreciated by all ages. ŒæThe book is designed to make people laugh and scratch their head as the characters seem to come to life.ŒæInkies -- ŒæSimple Drawings of Complicated People will surely be found on coffee tables, in briefcases and not so coincidentally -- doctors' waiting rooms."

I've dabbled in this style off and on for the past few years - but I always run into the same issues, minimal access to; lighting, make-up, hair, wardrobe & a knock out model. This is where you all can come in. Funding will cover photo studio rental, a make up artist & hair dresser. A wardrobe stylist and of course, the model. As well as covering costs for printed reward material, and of course my time.I'm looking to get this rolling by mid June, to early July.

1329," Hi, My name is Bill Murray (yes, just like the actor!) and for the past 20 years I've been drawing poster-size fantasy illustrations for my family, friends, children and grandchildren to color.Œæ My idea is to have 20 different 11""x17"" illustrations printed up on high-quality, thick art paper and pad-bound (no staples, no fold, posters printed on 1 side of each sheet only) to make a decently priced 20-page FANTASY POSTER COLORING BOOK for coloring enthusiasts of all ages.All of the artwork is finished and ready to be incorporated into the book. Most of the art is hand-drawn and physically inked before it is scanned in and touched up in Photoshop, including adding some effects and gray areas. Some of the posters employ very intricate and challenging ink line work, while others only use very tight pencil work and gray shading.Œæ It was not my intent to make your usual, every-day style of coloring book, and this is certainly not that.Œæ This coloring book is for colorists who want something much, much more interesting, challenging and rewarding to apply their skill to. I consider super-heroes to be a kind of fantasy, so there are a couple of super-heroish posters in the book.Œæ All of the illustrations are G or PG rated feature heroic men, women and many different creatures and exotic locations, some with detailed landscapes & backgrounds and others that leave the background more open to your coloring & artistic desire.Œæ The poster art is similar to what one might expect in comic books or in video games, with some violent themes but nothing explicit. The book will be 11""x17"" with all coloring pages printed on 67 lb vellum-bristol, which is a good commercial grade art paper that holds up to different coloring mediums. There will be a full-color cover (you see part of it as the project image at the top of this column) of an illustration found in the book.Œæ It will be pad bound at the top for easy poster removal, with a chip board back to give the book some support.Œæ To help maintain the integrity of the book when in transit they will all be shipped flat in a box, not curled up in a tube or easily bent in an envelope.Since I've worked in the printing industry for 17 years and also work freelance as a print designer & broker, I know exactly how to get this done and what it will cost in order to make it inexpensive enough to sell at my price point of $20 (which includes shipping & handling), and I already have estimates from the printers & bindery, and have a shipping box supplier.Œæ My price-break print run is 100, so I need to raise $2000 for this project.For those receiving the e-file versions, as soon as I receive your contact information at the end of the successful funding run, I will send you an email with links to all 20 coloring poster images on my website. Since each grayscale jpg is @ 5-8mb, this will be easier and more efficient than emailing the files to you or fumbling around with ftp protocols. You'll just click the link provided, wait until the image loads on your screen, right-click and save the image to your hard drive.I've found that colorists of all ages also enjoy inventing stories to go along with the art - they really stimulate the imagination.Œæ It is my desire to promote and inspire creativity in as many people as possible of all ages with these coloring books.My family & friends have really enjoyed coloring these imaginative & fun posters, and I'm hoping that enough others will feel the same way to make this project a reality! In fact, if you've read this far, then here's a free coloring poster sample everyone can download of the following image from the book...... just to try out my delivery mechanism for the e-files. Enjoy coloring it! I can easily adjust my hosting service parameters to accommodate the necessary bandwidth transfer. It is indicative of the resolution and detail you will find in all my fantasy coloring posters, and is one of the final posters for any $10, $20, or $100 pledge.Œæ Here's a picture of the signed poster print (colored by the artist - me) you get if you pledge at the $100 level - it's also in the book (not colored, of course):Thank you so much for your interest, and thanks to the developers of Kickstarter for this amazing opportunity and the fantastic community!!William J.

1331," Many of my friends, comrades and acquaintances have asked me where they can get a t-shirt of my Obama Sellout Poster. This artwork was made as a satire of the famous Obama/Fairey campaign poster of 2008. After experiencing Obama's failure to fulfill the promises and expectations of his election, it's clear to me he has sold us out to the corporations and their war machine. The extent of this ""sellout"" is described in the poster's background with a list of his broken promises and crony corporations. Locally Printed in Oakland, CA with Environmental Waterbased Inks on USA Made Cotton T'sI found a local printer who does great work with waterbased silkscreening on high quality American Apparel 4.3oz. t-shirts.

1333," Hello there! Thanks for taking some time to check out my project. My name is Jeff Dehut and I am an Illustrator living in Bowling Green, KY.I graduated from college about 5 years ago with a degree in Graphic Design and Photography and have been working commissions since then. I have a great idea to take a set of characters I call Folks and turn them into Greeting Cards.I began drawing these guys back in college and continued drawing friends and family through all kind of social media including Facebook and Instagram. My characters were a part of a short animated series on a local news station WBKO and samples of that can be see here:Œæhttp://tiny.cc/akn39ŒæThese were animated by my brother Craig Dehut.Though the Folks were widely popular on Instagram it is limited to the amount of people I can draw at once, and the audience is also limited to only those people on Instagram. Also, I can't make any kind of profit or living by giving away free digital portraits.I want to reach more people and I want to give them something tangible. My dream is to use this style of illustration to spread encouragement to as many people as possible. The best way I can imagine making that happen is to create Greeting Cards!I plan on preparing these cards to be ready to hit the market by Black Friday 2012. It will begin with an online store, then spread to local markets, from there THE WORLD! One day. (:This initial run will cover the cost of the web development, printing, shipping, marketing and design.I can't do this alone!

1336," I love Movies and Graphic Design. I decided to combine my passions to create a series of posters from my favorite movies.I designed three posters and I want to get them printed: The Silence of the Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, and The Matrix.

1337," Looking and seeing = the soul of the visual artist. ŒæRegardless of the medium ~ Œæit is in the time spent in understanding what one is actually seeing that allows for that information to be translated into some other form. ŒæOver the past several years, I have worked as a graphic designer, a photographer, a knitwear designer, and goldsmith. ŒæI have created ikebana installations, painted murals in restaurants, and produced entire fashion collections that have been shown in NYC. ŒæWhenever I look at a potential job opportunity, the employer inevitably asks for my credentials and whether or not I have performed these tasks before. ŒæThe heart of my answer is always the same. ŒæRegardless of whether I have done something before or not, I believe that can do it! ŒæIf it involves design, I can design it - or - ŒæI can creatively find a place to offer new perspective. ŒæThe root of this confidence stems from my deep understanding of design and aesthetics. ŒæWhether or not I have designed a shoe does not matter, the fact that I understand what a shoe is, what the function of a shoe is, and how a shoe can make one feel gives me the basis for designing something like a shoe. ŒæThen, because I understand design, I have that knowledge I bring to the project as well. ŒæFinally, understanding the human form gives me that final edge that makes my designs not just something that look good, but something that makes sense to the body, the mind, and tangible reality. Œæ..For the next 52 weeks, it is my goal to focus on that looking. ŒæTo hone my skills as an artist and my perception of life. ŒæTo really see the line, the contour, the shadows and depth of the human form. ŒæI believe that through doing this exercise, what I can offer to clients in the form of design will only be improved and heightened. ŒæBy the end of this 52 week in depth study, it is my intention to create one final folio of my work. ŒæIt will contain 52 drawings, be hand-bound in a traditional manner with ribbon tie, and organized in a chronological progression so that the development of my skill is evident in every line and shape on the paper. ŒæIt will include drawings taken from a variety of different timed poses along with some that will be hand colored in the rendering process.The funds raised through Kickstarter will offset the cost of sessions with a live model along with some minor supply requirements of paper and drawing tools...In short, whether it is the design for a chair that we sit on, the couch that we lounge in, the lighting in a dining room, the plate we eat off of.... Œæwhether it is the robe we wear, or the sheet we lie on.... Œæthe necklace that cascades over our collar bone or the earrings that dangle with each turn of the head... Œæregardless of what I am designing, the heart of that design is the human form. ŒæOur bodies inspire design, dictate design and can transform design. ŒæI hope that you will allow me to continue this journey into looking and really seeing. ŒæI thank you in advance for your kind support and generosity!Œæ."

1340," Iäó»m Sue Senden and I amcreating a Tarot deck with an unusual twist that I believe harkens back to itsorigins.Œæ When I first learned to read theTarot I felt that there was a connection between the Tarot and the Bible, especiallyin the Major Arcana.Œæ It was an idea thatresurfaced in my life many times.Œæ THE QUESTION: What if Tarotwas an early teaching tool of the Christian faith?Œæ Other examples of teachingdecks have survived from the 1400äó»s, so I looked into the idea a little deeper,and kept finding connections. ŒæŒæ Whenever I talk about a BiblicalTarot people ask me to say more, to show them some of the cards I have sketchedout, and to my surprise, they want to know how to get a set.Œæ Sadly, it has been an incomplete project onhold until I have enough time to devote to its completion.So we come to today andthe journey that I embark upon right here and now.Œæ If I do not do this now, I may never haveanother chance.Œæ I have given up my job, sothat I can delve into this project and devote my full time attentions to it insteadof stealing a few hours here and there inching closer to that goal. ŒæMuch like the journey of the Fool I am at thebeginning.Œæ The funding goal willinclude the printing of the initial set of limited edition decks, the bookletwith explanations, art prints, canvas, paints and the supplies needed to createthe original artwork for each card.Œæ Noneof these will be insubstantial costs.Œæ Iwill be pushing myself to complete these cards within the next six months, butbelieve it can be done. ŒæI begin this project fullof excitement mixed with the fear of stepping out on my own journey through thecreation of this deck.Œæ I invite you tojoin me to see where the Bible and the Tarot intersect.ŒæŒæŒæ Webegin today, right now, with you and your generous support.Œæ Thank you for being a part of this journeyand for making it happen.Œæ THE PREMISE:ŒæŒæŒæ The origins of the Tarot have been lost inthe shadows of the medieval world.Œæ Atthat time, the center of life was the church.ŒæMost people could not read or write. One of the best teaching methodsfor the church was through story, pictures and miracle plays.Œæ That is how I believe the Tarot came intobeing as a teaching tool to the masses.Œæ Thecards were created as a portable means of telling the story of faith, simplewood cuts printed on cloth since paper had not yet come to Europe.ŒæŒæ THE CARDS:ŒæŒæŒæŒæ Some of the oldest decks were commissionedby the Sforza family of Milan, Italy in the1400äó»s.Œæ They are beautifullyillustrated, painted in tempera and gilded on gold and silver.Œæ The Major Arcana cards have a hole in the topwhere they may have been hung on a nail so the image could be studied and themeaning meditated upon.Œæ It is from these earliestexamples that I base the creation of my deck.ŒæThere are differences in these early decks in the illustrations as wellas the cards that have been preserved.ŒæIt is interesting to see that a few of the Major Arcana Tarot cardschanged very little over the centuries while others have changed drasticallyand their original meaning muddled.Œæ For some of the changesthere are more easily referenced reasons for the changes.Œæ In the 1700äó»s the Tarot underwent the mostdrastic alterations when occultists wanted to tie the Major Arcana to the 22letters in the Hebrew alphabet and to hidden truths of the occult world.Œæ At that time some cards were eliminated.ŒæŒæŒæ THE FOOL:ŒæŒæŒæŒæ The fool is destitutebitten by dogs as he moves through a ruined landscape with broken buildings anddead vegetation.Œæ In his hair are sevenfeathers symbolizing ignorance.Œæ It isbleak.Œæ The Fool is impoverished materiallyand spiritually.Œæ This card is theseeker.Œæ It locates the hearer in thestory, and shows them their spiritual poverty at the beginning of thestory.Œæ The listener is takenthrough the stories depicted on the cards to at last reach the World, theculmination of what is available to them if they follow the Christian path inlife.ŒæŒæ The World card depicts the Kingdom of Heaven and it is theirs for followingthe path in life that the cards illustrate.ŒæŒæŒæŒæTHE DEVIL:ŒæŒæŒæŒæ This card has changed theleast down through the centuries.Œæ Themeaning is what has shifted drastically.ŒæAs the Church grew across Europe and the British Isles the Pagan beliefs were difficult to overcome.Œæ One in particular was the Cernunnos, thePagan god of fertility and the Forest.Œæ The gods of one religion become the demons ofthe next, and Cernunnos became the image of the devil.Œæ Cernunnos had antlers; the lower part of hisbody was goat-like in furry hair with cloven feet.ŒæŒæŒæ The seeker is challengedto give up the old Pagan ways, to take the chain that is about their necks andtoss it aside.ŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæŒæ THE HERMITIn the modern decks the Hermit has a lantern that he holds high for all to see.Œæ In the oldest cards he stands with an hour glass. He is the keeper of time.Œæ THANK YOUI hope you will join me on this journey into the place where the Tarot and Faith intersect.Œæ And thank you for your time and your generous support. "
1341," Think of one coloring book centered around a puffy-haired character of a darker hue. ŒæCan you think of any? ŒæI sure could not. ŒæWhen I was a little girl, all that were presented to me were the complete opposite. ŒæI was raised being exposed to infamous, lovable characters like Belle of Beauty and the Beast, Cinderalla, Snow White, Tinkerbelle and a countless amount of other characters that I looked nothing like. These characters were all over television and graced various products in stores.Although I still love those classic characters to this very day, there was a phase that I went through as a child where I felt ashamed of my appearance, thanks to the various media that was always presented to me. I do not want my daughter to end up with the same identity issues that I did as a child. ŒæI want her to feel free to be herself inside and out.ŒæI first resorted to only buying her books that contained non-human characters, but thanks to family members, she would still received books with human characters that she did not relate to. ŒæRather than having her throw those books away, I taught her how to alter the lines into something that she could relate to.I then realized that there should already be a coloring book with a character that she did not have to alter. ŒæSo to combat this issue, I created a puffy-haired character named ""Miss Zee."" ŒæMiss Zee represents my daughter and all the other little girls who are often left out.After I finished the first two pages of my daughter's custom coloring book, I shared the files on the internet free of charge and received an overwhelming amount of positive responses and a request for a line of coloring books that could be purchased.Like me, they all shared the same frustration with not having coloring books geared towards little girls of color. ŒæThis reinforced the fact that simple media like this is greatly desired.Your pledge will help supply this demand. ŒæIt is my hopes to have these coloring books distributed all over the world. ŒæPlease choose the amount that you would like to pledge by clicking on an amount on the right side of the screen.ŒæThank you!WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED ON:The money for this project will go towards printing and shipping. ŒæAlso, although these coloring books will be made for purchase, it is in my plan for some of these books to be set aside to donate and ship to organizations across the world.WHERE YOU CAN FIND US:www.misszee.netwww.facebook.com/misszeedoll"
1342," I will be producing a set of note cards from my unique artwork.I create surrealistic, highly rendered organic images, often incorporatingelements of trompe-läó»oeil (images thatappear three dimensional). For this project I am working in black andwhite, using pen and artistäó»s pencil.When I start my work, I start with loose, scribbling linesnot trying to create any particular image. As I continue to work and look atthe initial strokes I start seeing form emerge in what Iäó»ve done and I startdelineating more and the form becomes more well-defined. As I look at mydrawing more images and forms appear and I say äóìOh, THATäó»S what that is!äó and Icontinue to articulate the new form. As I work the form the trompe-läó»oeileffect can emerge for me to build on. For example, the image appears to floatoff the page in the vicinity of the lizard and the snakeäó»s head in Flower Pod.The title of Winding Snake and Eggs reminds me of Green Eggsand Ham. The Winding Snake and Eggs image is, to me, very feminine. I see Fallopianforms in the flowers. And I really like the quality of the (two-headed) snake.Œæ He almost disappears. I was going to addcolor to it and decided to leave it as a kind of ghost.What I love most about my artwork is that itäó»s a process ofdiscovery for me as the images more or less create themselves. The initiallines indicate what the form needs to be. Here are some additional examples of my work.If you like my artwork and want to support it, pleaseconsider pledging to my project. The funds will be used for materials,printing, matting, framing, shipping (international backers please addappropriate shipping costs to your pledge), time and energy. Any excess fundswill be used to purchase art materials and to continue promoting my artwork."
1343," Welcome to my FANTAZIES Hard Cover Book Project. This is literally 7 years in the making. My goal is to produce a high quality illustration book, of varying Fantasy images. For the last few years, Iäó»ve had a dream to create this book, and now it is within my reach to, as the title states, make my FANTAZIES come true.The Goal: The funding for this project will go to having the books printed, and shipped to me, help fund the pledge rewards, as well as repay my very understanding colorists, and reward them for their extreme patience. The funding will also go towards funding the limited rewards.The Book: Will be 48 pages of full color images, contained within a 9x12 Hard Bound Book.The Images: Although some may perceive the images to be risque - there is no nudity within the book. Only perceived. It is a pinup book of women in different fantasy realms, whether that be mermaids, angels, pixies, vampire girl, or even sci-fi girls. Having books printed, and then shipped from overseas is a lot more than I was anticipating, hence the reason I am here. I've looked into doing a less expensive soft cover book, but I feel that for the type of book that I want to put out, and be proud of, it needs to be a hard cover. Just a much better product, and a better representation of me, and my artwork. Hopefully you will feel the same.Reward: Below is a couple of the $200 rewards for an original, which measures 8-1/2 x 11 on card stock. Each of the Originals will be protected in a Hard Sleeve Top Loader - similar to a baseball card...only for artwork :)PRIZES:For the Second pledge, this is what you will receive:INCENTIVE ALERT!: GOAL REACHED! THANK YOU EVERYONE! THIS IS THE POSTCARD THAT ALL LEVELS WILL RECEIVE!Another INCENTIVE ALERT! And yet another Cool item - After some thought, and some major brainstorming with a close friend, I do believe, that I have this NEXT INCENTIVE figured out...See the 3rd update for more info :)YET ANOTHER INCENTIVE ALERT! And another Cool item (that has yet to be determined) to be added to all those that make a pledge should we reach THIS goal."
1344," Whether by order, oath, or honor, many have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting and dying for our country. But some carry an especially heavy share of deathäó»s burden when they are able to return from combat. Amidst lavish patriotic praise showered upon them by modern American culture for their devotion and bravery, they privately struggle to piece their lives back together while a dark war still rages in their minds. Inspired by our brave friends and family members returning from war, my brother, Alex, and I are motivated to create an exclusive illustrated tribute. It will express our awareness of the unique physical and emotional battles fought by todayäó»s service men and women coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.ABOUTŒæOUR PROJECTBrother and sister, tattoo artist and mortician, are teaming up to create an illustrated design that incorporates steadfast bravery, patriotic sense of duty, and the extreme emotional burden of combat survival, loss, and guilt. This illustration, rendered in modern graphic design, will acknowledge the sacrifices made by those who fought for our country.Depicting a combat-hardened soldier and the dead weight of the emotion he carries, this project will produce an exclusive graphic design which will ultimately serve as the cover art for our original graphic novel, A Few Good Dead Men.INSPIRATION FROM EVERYDAY LIFE (äó_and death)Iäó»m the one in the back dressed in black, directing everything. With a quick nod of my head, they move in trained precision. All eyes are on the two uniformed men, stooping sharply to retrieve the flag draping the casket. They snap their arms wide open and they stand as still and serious as statues securing the red, white, and blue tabletop over the box containing what remains of our neighborhood hero. All attention secretly turns to the young widow out front clutching a tissue in one hand and her son in the other. Their lives will never be the same. An unsettling crack physically jolts everyone in attendance, and although the orders are roared out in advance, we still jump at the next two volleys of the gun salute. Then the mournful triad of TAPS echoes through the cemetery. It resonates deep enough to shatter the soul of a young man in the front row. Heäó»s armored in pristine dress blues, but the uniform canäó»t protect him from his bereavement and the symptoms of his disorder. My name is Lacyn, and I am the mortician inspired by this young veteranäó»s emotional battle.My brother is the one with a needle in his hand. With a special gun and a puddle of ink, he can provide a unique remedy to help the young veteran. Memorial tattoos do more than just commemorate the loss of a combat comrade. They can immortalize the personal, emotional, and very harrowing experiences of war. My brother can deliver those eternal decorations in skillful quality. His name is Alex, and he is a tattoo artist.These experiences in our lives äóñ and many more like them äóñ have inspired us.For this project, Alex and I will combine our unique knowledge, skills, and encounters with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. We will pay tribute to the emotional conflict between patriotism, devotion, and absolute sacrifice for freedom.HOW KICKSTARTER CAN HELPSome of you may already know that Kickstarter offers artists a very unique opportunity to fund creative projects. Itäó»s a platform where an inspired idea can become a reality when backers pledge money in return for unique rewards from the project and its creators. When a project is launched, it remains on Kickstarteräó»s platform for a number of days to gain the interest of potential backers. When folks like you back, or pledge funds to, a project, running totals are kept. If the project reaches 100% pledged funding by the end of itäó»s run, the project comes to life. If it does not gain 100% pledged funding by the time the clock runs out, the project gets absolutely NO money. Itäó»s called äóìAll or Nothingäó Funding. So, in order to make this tribute happen and ensure that you get your unique backer rewards, our funding goals need to be reached 100%!Looking at the Rewards information on the right side of the screen, you can see that there are different rewards for various pledge amounts. In keeping with the theme of our tribute, we have separated the pledge levels into military-like ranks. But if you have any questions or ideas about MIXING-N-MATCHING backer rewards, please contact us! We are eager to please.*International Backers: Please contact us about the reward options available to you in case additional shipping costs need to be considered. Thanks!USE OF PROJECT FUNDSThe funds generated for this project through the Kickstarter platform will help us acquire much needed technology. Because Alex and I will be collaborating on this project long-distance, we need a quality scanner so he can send his sketches (for both the tribute itself and the backer rewards). Any additional funds will go toward the purchase of digital inking and colorization technology. We are looking into the technical capabilities of the Bamboo Create tablet by Wacom to help complete the final project tasks.ABOUT THE CREATORSLacyn may be an undertaker, but this blonde embalmer is not defined by her profession alone. She enjoys writing as a creative outlet, using her journal of work experiences as inspiration äóñ and you can bet that 10 years as a mortician adds up to a great many wacky and macabre tales! Lacyn is also a rodeo queen turned Vespa enthusiast that adores the rugged Arizona territory she calls home. At 6äó»4äó, Alex is Lacynäó»s younger äóñ but much taller äóñ brother. Heäó»s an artist with a spectacular knack for tattoos. Alex is also a new father! He has recently taken a job as an electricianäó»s apprentice to support his growing family. Although 360 miles of southwestern desert separates him from his sister, Alex is motivated to overcome the barriers of distance to bring his artistic talent to this inspired project.To learn more about Lacyn, Alex, and their project, please visit http://gooddeadmen.weebly.com thank you, Thank You, THANK YOU for learning more about this project!"
1345," I am trying to build my portfolio & print collection for March 2012's MidSouthCon. I have been slowly building my small freelance illustration/design business over the last few years & have 150+ books with my illustrations, cover art, & designs on/in them, but not many are in the genre of my preference, scifi/fantasy (which is why I majored in fine art to begin with, to become a cover artist for scifi/fantasy books). The video shows what I can do in the genre and where my work is leading.I am scheduled to be a guest artist at the local convention in March & will also have three full panel wall displays and a table in the art room for both presenting and selling my work. I have the honor of speaking as panelist to attendees at the convention. This means I will have direct contact with, and the attention of, hundreds of authors and publishers that are also interested in my genre of choice. It also means I will have to fill those walls and table with my scifi/fantasy art in hopes of one or more of the attending authors or publishers 'discovering' me & my work. I already have about half a dozen pieces ready for printing and framing but I need to prepare those for show while creating more works. I will need $1000 per print for the event. This would cover supplies for the creation of each, plus the printing, matting, and framing of each piece and te purchase of novelties, such as mouse pads, calendars, etc. Since Kickstarter has an all or nothing policy (meaning no contributions are released for the project unless I reach my project goal), I am only shooting to complete one print at $1000. Since I have to create some fresh art for this show (anything fewer than 20 works will look inadequate), I would love to re-create backers or their ideas as digital characters/scenes and place them in my portfolio, scenes of which they are welcome to make requests, such as 'make me an elf feeding a unicorn' or 'can you make my daughter a fairy frolicking with a bunch of butterflies'. Or, if you prefer, I could create a scene or cover for your book, website, or business (preferably fantasy in theme since that is the work I need to build and other themes would take from the time and materials I need for this project).Backers would be granted limited usage rights (such as just for your book or website - each case would be different according to the initial request) and you'd have a high rez file, that you could either print or display, that is custom to your wants or needs at a fraction of the true value, or in some cases, a signed 2012 calendar featuring the collection of works.Backers also receive free publicity for their book, website, or business via my website, blog, and other social networks."

The map will be informed by keynote speeches and community dialogue during a symposium titled ""The Downstream Neighbor""Œæon January 27-29, 2012.ŒæI will draw the map in real time during the different sessions of the three-day symposium. The map will creatively express all elements of the vision, in a form that reflects the organic, human, low tech process of community visioning work.This project is not intended as a fundraiser for this specific symposium. The project supports my creative work as a visual reporter and illuminator of strong community visions as they evolve on the spot, and start to shape the future.ŒæMeetings, brainstorming sessions and symposia are essential ingredients for visionary change and community engagement. However, they have a tendency to evaporate after the energy of the moment. I believe that artful listening and visual reporting are an expressive way to harvest both the content and the spirit of the conversations. The resulting visual report becomes a tangible tool for further communication and action.ŒæThis vision map would directly serve the communities that are connected to the South Platte River and would support the communication about projects that emerge from ""the Downstream Neighbor"". In addition, this map would be an inspiring and educational source of information for similar community water initiatives, both nationally and internationally.ŒæBy supporting the funding of this project you would help me to make a living in what I love most and do best: artful listening, synthesizing, drawing, organizing, sense making, and reporting on insights and information that make a difference.

1352," This summer, Lorie Hoffman and Charlie Capp will be floating by river from the mountains of Montana, all the way to the Pacific Ocean, a journey of 1,101 miles.  The expedition will take them across the landscape of the contemporary American West, by way of its most pivotal resource:  water.  Along the way, theyäó»ll be exploring how communities have been shaped by their relationship to the rivers, and create a portrait of the people linked from snow to sea.Our route will span four states, and just a little bit of Canada.  We wonäó»t be floating the entire length of the Columbia, which has itäó»s headwaters in the mountains of British Columbia, but weäó»ll be following a series of tributaries leading upstream to our starting point:  my familyäó»s ranch in the Bitterroot Valley.  From there, we will follow the Bitterroot River until it merges with the Clark Fork, which flows into the Pend Oreille, which connects to the Columbia, which ultimately joins the worldäó»s oceans at the Pacific.  Our route may seem like an open road, but there will be many obstacles and challenges along the way.  Dams segment the majority of the routes length, and the rocky rapids of summer present technical challenges of their own.Along the river we will be making an artistäó»s Journal/Sketchbook full of drawings, writings, photographs, and probably a water sample or two.Œæ Weäó»re going to take our time, if we come to a interesting place along the river we might stay a day or two to sketch. The project is about seeing whatäó»s along the way, documenting what we can, and sharing the journey with you. Weäó»re excited to get to the sea, but the process of getting there is whatäó»s important.Œæ When we return weäó»ll find a publisher for The Journal or weäó»ll publish it ourselves. Either way, itäó»s going to be one incredible Journal, and an intimate look into two artistäó»s sketchbook style.The genesis of this project is rooted in Charlie's childhood, in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana.  The river forms the western border of my familyäó»s ranch, and as such was a constant backdrop to my life there.  Itäó»s the river I learned to fish on, and it supported the forested river bottom I explored as a kid.  These explorations cultivated my interest in the natural world, a curiosity that is still with me today in my scientific and artistic pursuits.  As the years passed, I grew curious about where the water ultimately went.  I knew it went at least as far as Missoula, and ultimately ended up in the Pacific Ocean, but what was it like in between?  What sort of places relied on the water that flowed down from the mountains and past our ranch?  Our family depended on the water of the valley to raise cattle and hay, but what about other families, and other communities?  I wanted to one day travel the length of the river to meet the people and see the places that all share the water, and that day is now coming up. ŒæBecome a backer by pledging to the project.

1353," My name is Peter Wallis.Œæ I am avisual artist from the Green mountains of Vermont.Œæ I am working on a series of Childrenäó»s Booksthat explains the history and origin behind Idioms, Phrases and Metaphors.Œæ Working with both younger students andstudents learning English I came up with an idea for a series of Childrenäó»sBooks that explains the origins of common idioms, phrases and metaphors.ŒæŒæ It is a great educational tool and also is afun book that both adults and children can learn from.For example:In medieval Europe both Cats and Dogs were not allowed indoors.Œæ Often times they would sleep in the hay roofsof homes, when it would rain the hay roofs would loosen up and cats and dogswould fall from the ceiling.Œæ Thus themeaning of äóìRaining Cats and Dogsäó was born.ŒæMy overall goal is to publish this first book and have the funding, studiospace and the time to complete all three books in the series.Œæ This is an informative read for adults andchildren and a great teaching tool for anyone learning English idioms, phrasesand metaphors.Œæ To see the progress of this work visit my blog @http://inventingidioms.wordpress.com/"

1355," I plan to have the book self-published and the money you pledge will help get the book available and in major markets like Barnes & Noble and Amazon. ŒæIt will also allow me to have professional photographs taken of all the watercolor illustrations. ŒæA big portion of the funding will assist in getting the book introduced with a large professional marketing campaign. ŒæI think exposure is the key to the books success. ŒæThe rest of the funds will go toward getting you ladies and gents your cool pledge rewards and getting them shipped to you. ŒæI try to be prepared but it always surprises me how quick the little costs ad up to be one big cost. ŒæSo hopefully I got it right this time. ŒæThank you again for your support.

Then select the green ""BACK THIS PROJECT"" rectangle to the right to select a pledge level and receive a reward for your support of this inspiring project. If you prefer not to receive a reward you will be given that option and you can just make a pledge. Any pledge is a huge boost to this project. We don't need much to allow a very unique work to be installed that will inspire families for decades.There is a Christmas gift option when you make a pledge. Scroll to the bottom to read how.What we hope to accomplish and how it's been made possibleBy pledging to this project, you have an opportunity to have your work included in a 5-by-7-foot collaboration drawing. Yes, this is an exciting opportunity for a small piece of your work to be included and donated to a nonprofit organization that supports families through their work. Prints are also available and your purchase of a print will help place this image in more locations to expose families to this wonderful work.This artwork is being created to honor the accomplishments of Mother Teresa and to help us continue to be passionate about what we do. Without passion there is no inspiration for our kids and no opportunity to dream. ""Someone for a Moment"" comes from Mother Teresa's philosophy of doing little things to spread compassion to those who are closest to us. The embrace in this image gave this child life for a moment. That is something we are all capable of and this work will be a reminder.The photograph of Mother Teresa at an orphanage in Calcutta, captured by the photojournalist Raghu Rai in India, has stirred my imagination. This image radiates the compassion Mother Teresa must have felt as she struggled to do her work. It is arguably the single most important image of her life's accomplishments. Our young need our guidance, our strength, and our compassion. This artwork will help remind us of her work and guide us to have responsible, committed, loving families.In 1998 I created a graphite pencil drawing, based on that photo by Raghu Rai, and gave it as a gift to my mother-in-law. Since then, I've been creating larger works and I now want your help and your small drawings, to be able to assemble a 5-by-7-foot version of this drawing. Raghu Rai has generously given us his permission to move ahead with our project. His representative, Magnum Photos, has also graciously cleared the way for this project.My InspirationI've been exposed to the works of many artists. Several have had a lasting impression. Two of those artists, David Mesplí© and Chuck Close, have influenced my work. I was fortunate to meet David Mesplí© in 1993 while I was working towards my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. I'll never forget the detail in his drawings and the scale of his work. Later, I was exposed to the work of Chuck Close at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was a photorealist in the 1970's and continues his work today. These artists are able to pull you into the work in a way that makes you feel the emotion, rather than standing in front, removed from the work. It's a very intimate moment when you approach their work. This is what I want to achieve with this collaboration drawing project.Early SuccessThrough the process of putting together this project, we have already accomplished more than we thought possible. Early interest and print sales have allowed us to donate a few prints to help in several ways. The Children's Hospital and Health Systemä‹¢ Foundation in Milwaukee, WI received a donated framed print from us for their annual ""Bids for Kids"" fundraiser that was held on November 9th, 2011. The artwork was donated to honor a local 4 year old boy who touched many lives during the short time he had.We were also able to donate a framed work to a local hospital for the national ""Paint the Town Pink"" silent auction fundraiser that helps create awareness of breast cancer and the importance of mammograms.Two health care professionals have purchased the print and one is already on display in a women's health clinic lobby.I've seen people overcome with emotion when they look at the print. I've heard the compassion in their voice while discussing the importance of this work. I know we will be able to do much more and it's overwhelming to consider what this project can accomplish.Supporting Our ProjectYour pledge will allow us to purchase the raw materials, fabricate and coat the framework, purchase the tempered glass, ship it to the hospital, and install the work. Every pledge is important.Much is Already AccomplishedWe've put a lot of effort into this project already. Raghu Rai has given us his approval, the smaller drawing for the prints has been completed, the image is ready for the archival limited edition prints, and the supporting framework for the large artwork has been designed and rendered. It's been years in the making and now we need your support to make this vision a reality. It's time for you to have these prints, to be a part of the collaboration, and help me put this wonderful work in an organization where it will have the greatest impact.This is a little extra information about a couple of the different support levels we have.$25 & $35 pledge levels. The Collaboration graphite drawing.If you choose to support us with a $25 or $35 pledge you will receive a reward package containing:äó¢ an envelope with a reference image of the drawing divided into the squares that will make up the final image with your square highlighted,äó¢ a 2-by-2-inch reference square mounted alongside a numbered blank 2-by-2-inchŒæsquare for you to use to create your drawing that will resemble the reference square,äó¢ everyone will receive the same type of graphite pencil to help keep the quality of the combined sections consistent,äó¢ and a return envelope for you to send back the square you've completed your drawing on. Remove and keep your sample square and leave the square you've drawn attached to the card it was delivered on. Insert it into the provided envelope and send it back to us. We will do the rest.The Collaboration work is a unique opportunity for you to create a 2-by-2-inch drawing that will be joined with others to complete the 5-by-7-foot Mother Teresa graphite drawing. You can choose the $25 pledge and receive a section of the background that will look similar to one of these samples:or the $35 pledge and receive a section of the foreground image area that will include a section of Mother Teresa or the child. It may look something like one of these samples:No solid white sections will be sent. Everyone has the opportunity to be a part of this collaboration work while sections remain available. Any sections not claimed or returned to us will have the original image showing through that area. If many sections are still available when this project is successfully funded we will have local children complete the remainder.$100 pledge level. A signed limited edition print of Mother Teresa.If you choose the $100 pledge, one of the rewards you will receive is a signed limited edition print of Mother Teresa with a child. You do have the option (excludes international orders) to have us professionally frame the print with a high quality metal frame and double mat. All materials are archival. Several framed print sample images have been included below. If you choose to have it framed, add an additional $150 to your funding total. Shipping is included.If we raise more than our goal, you will help fund a drawing and framework that I will create. It will also be donated to an organization like a hospital, clinic or family support agency. I would like that opportunity but I hope we can at least accomplish the main goal of this project and create your collaboration drawing and find it a good home.Thank you for taking some time to learn about this project. I hope you can find a way to make a pledge and help this project come to life.If you would like to pledge and give the reward as a gift, I will post printable cards, FOR ALL PLEDGE LEVELS, on our website www.lookcreative.com that you can print and give as a Christmas gift to someone. The card will let them know that you are supporting this project in their name and it will explain what they will be receiving. Later, after our funding goal is a success, I'll request names and addresses and that's when you can indicate who and where the reward will go to. This is a very unique gift and in the spirit of Christmas giving. It not only brings someone you love closer to this wonderful work, it helps me, the artist. continue doing the work I love."
1358," The Gray Wolf Graphic Book project is an international artisticcollaboration to produce an illustrated story of the gray wolf in NorthAmerica. The book will tell the story of the gray wolf from its evolution,ecological role,Œæ eradication from western states to its reintroduction in the West.The story of the Gray Wolf is still unfolding today with the species delisting from the Endangered Species Act in 2011 and as debate continuesover wolf management with population increase and expansion of their range into newstates. The book will be illustrated in the style of a graphic novel and will appealacross generations. The book will tell the story like it is, based on true events through quality illustration. The illustrator for the project is Ramí_n Acedo, a free lance illustrator & architect based in Madrid Spain.Œæ Ramí_n has a passion for wolves and his illustrations areinfused with emotion that truly bring wolves and western landscapes to life throughthe use of traditional and digital illustration techniques. The illustrationswill be highly detailed and will allow each page to stand alone as a work ofart. The concept for the book and script was developed and written by Noah Bates, a rangeland ecologistbased in Colorado, United States.The book will be the inaugural publication of EarthIllustrated Press, an independent publisher owned and operated by Noah Bates that creates illustrated books with ecological themes. The book will be printed inhard copy in a limited edition initial press run and will also be made available as ane-book for retail sale. We are working on a tight budgetand our goal is to raise $4,500 in 45 days that will be matched by personal funds and dividedbetween illustrations, first press run and e-book formatting. The book is scheduled to be released in November 2012. We hope you are inspired to contribute to this project andhelp make the book a reality.You may keep abreast of project developments at the websiteof Earth Illustrated Press.

1360," I am a NYC Illustrator who loves the Gilded Age of Manhattan, 1890's-1910. ŒæIt was a period of true epic expansion and discovery in New York City. ŒæI find the buildings and structures during this time to be masterpieces of construction and innovation. ŒæI have had many shows in New York that feature my building illustrations. ŒæMy dream is to make an impact with my art and to launch my art journey that will showcase the glory of Old Manhattan. ŒæWith successful funding I plan on creating new print pieces from my recent illustrations and submitting to online and traditional galleries. ŒæMany of these galleries now require submission fees. ŒæI would also like to market my shows via web and traditional media. A long term dream would be to open a small gallery in NYC, selling prints, originals and merchandise. Œæ(Similar to Keith Haring's Pop Shop...Ooooh that would be nice.)I have had much positive feedback on my Illustrations and I feel that I am on the precipice of success. ŒæI just need my art to be seen by the right art people and the masses and my journey will take a giant step forward.

1361," I am a wood engraver and illustrator. (If you are not sure what a wood engraving is - please watch the video!) My Kickstarter project is called the Cat of the Month Club. It began with a long time desire to do a series of wood engravings, but life kept getting in the way!Œæ This project will give me the incentive to do the series and will give the sponsor a tangible reward for his/her moneyŒæ - so the sponsor is not merely investing in an idea or concept, but actually receives a valuable piece of artwork.I have always owned cats and we all know that they are incredibly personable and also very popular! Most people who collect cat items are very hard to buy for because they already have so many cat items. This is where my idea for a series and the desire to come up with a unique reward for the sponsor merges.The Cat of the Month Club will consist of one wood engraving a month: I will draw, carve, print, and mail a new cat image at the start of each month. The complete series will have 12 cat engravings and an archival box to store them in (the traditional way to collect fine art prints). I have put a short deadline on this project (Dec 15), so if the project goes through - those that may want to do this as a Christmas gift will be assured that the project has been funded. I will notify all recipients by e-mail and also send a gift card explaining how the series works and to let the gift recipient know to expect their first piece of art in January.To view more of my wood engravings and woodcuts, please go to my website at: www.laughingcrowstudio.com."
1362," Welcome to my Kickstarter page. This is a crowd funding medium to help projects get off the ground. I am asking you to pledge anywhere from $1 and up to help me get this artwork into poster. If I don't meet my goal...your card is not charged.....but also you don't get your goodies... So Please share this with someone you love. Check out my rewards to help inspire you to pledge.Œæ I am offering this art on poster Full Size, or canvas prints, the original drawings, also the OG paintings are in the rewards should you so desire.The concept of this painting is to create an image you see from far away that is made up of something entirely different when you examine it closer. ""Two Faces"" is just that from far away, however these faces are made up of 100's of people, places and things all compiled into the giant monoliths which guard all it's inhabitants. If you look close you can see some items are in white...these are the final characters I am still working on and will be complete in time for the poster run.  Enjoy endless epic details in this painting titled ""TWO FACES"" by Chris Elliman. Incredible perspective and depth insures your mind will be blown for years of discovery and conversation discussing,"" What does it all mean?""Œæ Many items are very obvious and others are not. After working with subliminal imagery for years.... I grew frustrated working hard to hide items in my paintings..... only to have to point them out to people directly in the final piece.....hence my more obvious approach to subtlety! Creating paintings of this magnitude is very challenging both mentally and fiscally. To be able to pay bills for three months while I hammer down on these canvas' with complete focus has created some interesting highs and lows in my financial history. I am so into these pieces I forget to eat, sleep and have a life! Yikes.... but that's how passionate I am about this kind of rendering.Œæ There is no chance for a 9-5 moment when I have one of these on the easel. It's full throttle coffee sipping and depth enhancing debauchery. I have found the way to really get my point across is to make less quantity and more quality. Yes I could paint a painting a day... or five for that matter... but none would sock you in the eye like this. Time and time again I have proven this is how you make an impression..... now its your turn...... bring ""Two Faces""Œæ home to your wall. I absolutely need your help to be able to afford the large minimum orders required for long run printing on drum printers. The very costly start up fees are tough to summons from my humble pockets, but the price of each singular piece goes way down. These are not one off prints from a digital printer and not photographed by a buddy with a nice camera. The painting has been photographed by a professional art photographer on a Hasselblad H1! The images are over a half a gig each side!

1364," 2011 marks the 70th anniversary of one of films greatest (some say the greatest) monsters; the Wolfman. Immortalized by Lon Chaney Jr., the film remains one of the most watched and highly regarded pieces of cinema ever committed to screen. George Waggner's vision of a man inflicted with a terrible curse has forever changed the way we view the ""monster"" in movies, as human to inhuman, as conflict with self against the nature of being. A well rounded cast propels the yarn; cemented in history with the fine performance of Bela Lugosi, whom ten years earlier made another monster a household name (I'll let you Google it if you don't already know the answer). Time has shown that this story, although some would consider tame by contemporary standards, still resounds with audiences seven decades after it's release I'll admit that I was not always a fan of this film as it was not a staple of my childhood like many other horror aficionados, but a recent viewing delighted me with how well it has stood up over time. Snappy dialog, an unusually deep plot, and par none special effects (even for today) brought the story to life and made me more or less realize why this work has endured and even flourished with the passing of time. Modern takes have always had to resort to comedy (An American Werewolf in London) or intense gore (the 2010 remake) to even hope to separate itself from the original. This film has done more for the genre of horror than many others since including several personal favorites like The Shining, Alien, or The Evil Dead series, any artist would kill for the staying power this film has had and continues to have.The work in question begins as a rough diagram; an illustrated poster harkening back to the yesteryear of design when pencil hit paper and brush met canvas. But I hope through a dialog with fans alike would blossom into a far more personal reflection of what this film has meant to the legion of folks who admire it today. In the coming days and weeks I wish to update and polish the concept into something worthy of walls, dorm rooms, and collections. Something we as fans can all look at and say ""damn, that was a fine film."" Originally, I was inspired two fold; first by a revisiting of the work and also by the poster artist Drew Struzan, who recently created a piece inspired by a film he admired as a child; Frankenstein. His work in turn has spurred me in much the same way, to create something beautiful, lasting, and a reflection of what the film meant to him.The final product will be a full format 4-color offset archival print, signed and numbered. Additionally a lobby card will also be created, screen printed on archival paper and packaged along with the poster as an additional bonus for fans who would love to see this project completed. A special edition will also be produced, a screen print enhanced version of the offset print or an entirely screen printed original.I look forward to hearing back from people interested in the project and to see what avenues it leads to. My thanks viewing and reading through my ramblings but most importantly; thank-you for your time and consideration.J. Aaron Hager"
1365," Leonardo Da Vinci's masterpiece, the Mona Lisa is perhaps the world's most famous and iconicŒæpainting, and one of its greatist Art treasures. But the Mona Lisa today is badly darkened, yellowed and riddled with cracks.The Restoration project recreates the original brilliant colors, life-like flesh tones, fine details, and the dazzling landscape that so enthralled Leonardo's early admirers.Working from research based on high-tech scans, numerous early copies and manuscripts, David A. Claerr has digitally re-created an amazingly detailed restoration thatŒæprovides the viever with an accurate likeness of the painting as if fresh from Leonardo's easel.Details that were obscured or lost by the ravages of time, such as the gold brocade on her bodice, the transparent veil, eyelashes and eyebrows, and the rosy flesh-tones described by the art historian Vasari, are depicted in vivid color. Intruiging landscape elements, such as the eroded limestone pinnacles, the sapphire mountain lakes and the coursing riverŒæin the backgroundŒæare visible in the Fine Art print.The entire artwork was painstakingly hand-painted, using a digital tablet and brush, and edited pixel-by-pixel in many of the minute details."

I'm a free lance illustrator as well as being a full time student at the Academy of Art University, BFA Illustration program with a focus on visual development. I'm a self labled dork, I love fairytales, fantasy, art and history and I am hoping to share those passions with you. Please feel free to be a dork/nerd/geek along with me.So what are the books?1. Anne McCaffery - Dragonriders of Pern.2. G. R. R. Martin - A Song of Fire and Ice3. William Goldman - The Princess Bride4. Robert Jordan - The Wheel of Time5. Peter S. Beagle - The Last Unicorn6. Tamora Pierce - Tortal based, series not decided yet.7. Robin McKinely - The Blue Sword or The Hero and the Crown8. Sherwood Smith - Crown Duel9. Anne Bishop - The Black Jewels10. Mercedes Lackey - Vows and Honors trilogy [Valdemar]11. Scott Lynch - The Lies of Locke Lamora12. To be decided...by the patrons! That's you.ŒæWhy such a far off deadline?For several reasons actually. I am planning to hopefully have everything done and shipped out by next November. The reason there's such a lengthy project ahead of me, and my supporters is because I really do mean a high quality illustration for each one, I don't want to do short cuts or fail the brilliance I'm illustrating. That means 60-100 hours or so per illustration, from thumbnails to final piece and mix that in with being a full time student and engaged along with private commissions and otherŒæresponsibilities. However if you chose to become a part of this you will get to see each piece come to life through livestream and at least bi weekly updates for the patrons.ŒæWhy the sum of $5,000?Because its costly to print high quality calendar's and I don't mean the more flimsy ones often bought in stores. And the mini book and other expenses along with shipping, art isn't cheap. And there's paying the artist as well, because hopefully you like me and want to pay me for the work I'm doing. And I will treat this like a job, its a commitment I've made and I will carry it through and happily answer any other questions. $6000 is a rough estimation of what would be needed for everything, honestly the more I raise the better rewards I can give and the more stress it takes off me.ŒæSo....help me make somethingŒæextraordinary.ŒæBelow are a few of my favorite original pieces though none of them has quiet the style I have in mind for this project.Œæ"
1367," I love stories. Problem is, myfirst language isnäó»t English, itäó»s images. So I got a Medieval English major atOglethorpe University and became an Artist. ŒæArtists use images to express thoughts andfeelings, explore issues, explain what we believe to others, and so much more.Abstract or realistic, old fashioned or modern, the art that lasts is the artthat grabs you and makes you want to look at it.Iäó»ve specialized in paintingportraits in costume, making costumes and setting the stage (literally) forindividuals to show a different story of themselves than they usually get totell. My work tends to be quiet and personal. People think itäó»s beautiful, butwho wants to hang a picture of someone elseäó»s friend on their wall? What makesthe images in Sargent, Waterhouse, Da Vinci, or Le Brun more universal? Iäó»mready to explore this and capture it in my own art.Specifically, I want to produceworks that capture the feeling of a story and make the viewer want to knowmore. ŒæI want my physical art to engage theviewer as completely as stories engage the listener or reader. To achieve this, each day I willproduce small sketches & thumbnails based on stories, some classical, somemodern, and some my own. Each week I will choose from these the best ideas andproduce one or more finished sketches in dry medium or paint. Each month Iäó»lluse the best of these compositions to create a finished painting. ŒæIn the end, I will have a book of my work to presentto art directors and galleries. The book will include both my art and some ofthe stories behind it. Your funding will go toward supplies, studio space, andproducing the book. In exchange, you will get anywhere from a small sketch to afinished painting - and, of course, my eternal thanks. The way Kickstarterworks, until the goal is met no money changes hands, so please pledge what youcan to help me tell my stories."

1369," Explore the Magic of the Doodle with my hand-drawn creations.Œæ My drawings are greatly detailed and original, geared toward teenagers and adults.Œæ One is never too old to color and the benefits of doing so are endless!Œæ Mental discipline, patience, relaxation, creativity and joy all stem from my designs.Œæ My coloring art products produce hours of coloring creation fun.Œæ My drawings have also been used in treatment centers with positive feedback from those struggling with addictions, mental health issues and other similar conditions.I have already created and printed one Doodle Art coloring book containing 10 original drawings and a Doodle Art Poster (Size 18x24).Œæ I put everything I had into this first project so that I would be able print enough books to sell them at a low cost on my website, www.doodle-art-alley.com. My website also offers free coloring pages that are inspired by the doodle but not nearly as detailed as the pages in my Doodle Art Coloring Book.Œæ Many people who have purchased and used my book and poster love them and are anxiously awaiting my next creation.Œæ The money raised will be used to print my next coloring art book and poster.Œæ This book and poster will be nature themed, showing different settings and characteristics of nature all hand-drawn in my own Doodle Art Alley style.Œæ Any additional money raised will be used to print additional posters and books if possible."
1370," Iäó»m Monica and Iäó»m a free lance illustrator. ŒæIf youäó»re into Tarot cards, you might know my work from the Tarot of the Dead, a Day of the Dead themed tarot deck that I created.The project Iäó»m working on now is the Stolen Child Tarot. ŒæThe name and inspiration for this deck came from one of my favorite poems, the Stolen Child, by William Butler YeatsŒæ -- in particular the refrain:  äóìCome away, O human child!To the waters and the wildWith a faery, hand in hand,For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.äóTo create the atmosphere of the poem, Iäó»m designing the imagery without man-made objects like the usual tools you would see in a traditional deck -- for example, a crown could be represented by antlers, or an animal's form could represent the clothing for a human station. Also, there wonäó»t be any adult figures. ŒæThe humans in this deck are all changeling children that have embraced different parts of the natural world.My hope with this campaign is to be able to complete the 22 cards of the major arcana, plus 2 title cards, and produce a small print run of these as a complete entity.Œæ My illustrations are done with colored ink and watercolor and have shading and detail that will not reproduce at good quality with online print on demand services--that's where Kickstarter comes in!Reaching my Kickstarter goal will allow me to finish and produce this project with a local printer utilizing profession 4 color process that will accurately reproduce the color and detail of the originals.Œæ Creating this art edition of the major arcana will hopefully be the first step to developing a full deck in the future -- and I've included some minor arcana artwork in the video.To make these editions special for supporters of the project, each deck will be signed and numbered, a title card will include an area to personalize it to the recipient with a name or small drawing-- you tell me what to include! -- and packaged in a handmade art paper portfolio.Œæ No two will be exactly alike!Œæ About 10-20 of the decks will be hand embellished on the title cards with metallic ink and packaged in a sewn cloth portfolio with ribbon/button enclosure to create a deluxe edition.All pledge rewards include shipping and all pledge levels will be signed up for behind the scenes updates on the project!Along with the cards, I will create a PDF field guide to the deck with thumbnails of each image and interpretations, which will be available for all supporters of the project.If you would like to pledge at the original artwork level, you can see the gallery of available cards here and claim your card!If you would like to pledge at the Pendant level, you can see an example of what the completed pendants will look like here!When will the project complete?I should have all artwork completed by the end of the year and to the printer by early January.Œæ My goal is to have completed decks in supporters hands by Valentine's Day.What is Kickstarter?If you are new to Kickstarter, Kickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform for creative projects. ŒæYou can pledge money at different reward levels, or at any amount you choose. ŒæIf the funding goal is reached, as a supporter, youäó»ll receive a unique personalized piece of art as a thank you from me.Œæ If the funding goal isnäó»t met, the project ends and no money changes hands."
1371," Overview: The ABC's of Oregon flora, fauna and et cetera. My name is John Maddin, and I have been creating highly detailed Scratchboard art for a number of years now, and most recently I've made a number of images all dealing with the indigenous plants, animals and other things that illustrateŒæ my home state of Oregon.Œæ The trick is to get this artwork seen by more people.Œæ Eventually what I'd like to do is get an artist booth set up at the local artist market, as well as an online store, but first I need to create some product.Œæ In addition to the Eagle that you see in the profile shot, here's the other images I want to turn into T-Shirts:http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5268310132/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5457808338/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5200829748/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5279739842/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5521055925/in/set-72157625462231399But, of course, like so many starving artists out there, I'm usually financially challenged.Œæ So......The money will be used to:Create an initial line of T-Shirts and Hoodies (we Oregonians LOVE our Hoodies...!).Œæ There will be at least 6 different images, all in various different sizes and colors to choose from.

1372," The idea behind this project was to capture the beauty of Kansas City during the Christmas season. We have been to the big commercial displays to the smallest neighborhood displays to show the wonder of our great city. The research, photos, and transcript are all done. The money is to pay for the cost of getting the book printed. We are looking to print 100 copies to start out and go from there. "
1373," How many of us give real pleasure with our art to others for free?? I am a childrens illustrator from India. I have been creating these cute personalised cartoons of friends & family & clients for over an year now & have got numerous requests from many known and unknown people for more. Most of these have been used as user profiles on various social networking sites or as web mascots or even as greeting cards etc.. People can personalise these cartoons for anything they want, from personal identification to personalised gifts. The best part is they are ABSOLUTELY FREE! Graphic artists & cartoonists around the world charge a bomb for a small cartoon version of you. I wanted to reach out to many others who don't know me all around the world and give them the joy of owning a specially done cartoon version of themselves absolutely FREE!I have decided to dedicate one full day, that is a full continuous non-stop 24 hours to draw for other's delight. I will be taking in 1000 requests from people all around the world to draw a cartoon of theirs or their friends or family. You just need to send me a photograph of the person whom you want to convert into a cartoon & it will be done right in front of you on a live web camera via skype, with my webcam focussed on my illustration at my desktop and everything I would draw and create while this period will be broadcasted live onŒæhttp://www.livestream.com/thousandliverequestsŒæduring this period. Each cartoon will be personally sent to you via email instantly as soon as it is done and you can see it almost immediately & use wherever you want. NO COPYRIGHT CHARGES!Whats More?You can personalise the cartoon in your own way with a special background for example, for a birthday with cakes & candles or an anniversary with a couple sitting over a moon or congratulations for a new job with any specific setting you have in mind. Everything is welcome! You just have to mention what you want in the background for me to draw in chat or with the photograph. Plus each of these cartoons will be published in one of its kind special book dedicated to this day with special thanks to all who contributed and supported it. This book will be known as ""1000 Live Cartoon Requests"" as will have the original photographs and names of the people along with the cartoon and where they are from.What would I need the money for?All your money would be used for the printing and publishing of the book and for the creation and promotion of a website where such requests would be taken everyday. This is my life long dream to provide some special touch to my art for everyone around me. So that everyone owns something special or personalised gifting is not so much pain and is readily available.ŒæWhen will this ""Request Day"" happen?If the funding goes successfully the 1000 Requests Day will start on 2nd December 08:00am IST. All the requests that will be sent to my email id, mukherjee.aiswarya@gmail.com from that moment will be considered valid for the day. I will be taking the first 1000 requests for that day and will be contacting and completing each drawing preferably live for the person who requested via skype. So please send me your Skype id alongwith your request.What should you sent via the email request?Please send a photograph of the person you want us to draw with his/her name and location, alongwith any specific background details you want us to draw or any specific text line you want to add, for example: ""Happy Birthday Lisa!"".

1374," ŒæŒæ Capture your likeness in a bold and interesting way! The Autum season is here and our thoughts turn toward Halloween, horror movies and good old macabre fun. I'm offering up your chance to have your likeness transformed into either a bio-mechanical steampunk creature or a ravenous, blood thirsty zombie. Of course, you can always just get yourself drawn just as you are as well. I'm also offering up some cool artwork featuring classic horror icons Edgar Allan Poe and the original Dracula, Bela Lugosi. I've set their images on paper using the ""fumage"" technique, which utilizes candle soot to create images.ŒæŒæ*** If you want a portrait, I would like at least three photo's of the person you want drawn. Please make sure there is an equal amount of light and shadow in the pic, especially on the face. Please feel free to make scary faces for the zombie portraits. Portraits include head and partial upper body.***ŒæŒæ I want to put on my first solo show early in 2012. Basically, I want to raise money to make this happen. The majority of it will go toward mounting, framing, space rental, fixtures and hopefully some entertainment and light snacks. The more money I raise, the more impressive I'll be able to make my show. ŒæŒæ I've been painting in oils for only a few years but have been blessed with an artistic gene that has enabled me to hone my skills rather quickly. I prefer to paint finely detailed still life and portraits. Having always had an interest in the macabre, I also love to create images that present a dark and forboding feeling. My paintings usually include a dark background and striking contrasts. I also love to draw and have been doing it for more years than I can recall. Hence the basis for this project. ŒæŒæ Your portrait will de drawn on an 18"" x 24"" sheet of professional drawing paper. Once completed, it will be sprayed with a few coats of fixative for protection. Then it will be sent off to you in a mailing tube via USPS. ŒæŒæ I'm currently trying to lock in a venue to host my show for mid March. I'll be posting updates throughout this project and will post the exact time and place of the show once I secure it. The show will be free to attend so PLEASE show up if you can.   Thank you very much!"
1375," My approach todrawing is simple; it is to try to push it to the brink. I never have remainedsatisfied with just pencil to paper. I have strived to do more and that hasbrought me to my current body of work. The seven drawings I have just completedshowcase the progress of wood, mechanical pencil, stumps, erasers, and havingthe graphite drip. The imagery is pushed as well including subjects such as horses, bighorns, crowns, humans, ships, flags, birds, etc. ŒæSo here is where my kickstarter project comesin. ŒæWith several pieces donealready, I want to evolve these ideas and processes to create five moredrawings, and finish my series. As the project develops I will continue workingon wood, share my thoughts and show in progress photos of all stages of thework.Œæ When all the work is done printsof all works in the series will be available.Œæ ŒæThis will allbe documented in an artist book, which will be available exclusively to mywonderful backers on kickstarter.ŒæAs if that werenäó»t cool enough, the originalworks will also be offered!Œæ I wantall funders to have the opportunity to get their hands on originals.Œæ That means the large panels will be forsale, and for those of you with a little less room on your walls, I am making apiece composed of twenty smaller panels that will all be up for grabs.ŒæŒæIf you would like to check out more of my workfeel free to go to my website at www.jasonanthonyleroy.comŒæThank youfor taking your time and checking out my work.Best,ŒæJason"

1377," I will create a series of drawings which document a cross section of the U.S. landscape between Boston, MA and Los Angeles, CA. Traveling by car I will sketch and illustrate cityscapes and landscapes at set points along the way.ŒæDuring the 3,000 mile journey from Boston to LA I will produce about 120 illustrations which visually record the gradual progression between the countyäó»s various natural landscapes and ecosystems as well as the transition between rural, suburban and urban places.ŒæI plan to use lines of latitude as markers for my illustrations. The distance between these lines vary while traveling north to south so the illustrations will be somewhere between 25 and 35 miles apart. This will allow me to capture enough of the country to represent the various and wide ranging landscapes and to convey a sense movement along the road.Being from New England I am very familiar with northeastern landscapes and cities. I have sketchbooks full of illustrations depicting them, some abstract some more detailed. This trip will give me the opportunity to explore other parts of the country in depth. Weekend trips or even week long vacations have given me only a sense of what other parts of the country are like at any given moment. A drive across the country with the purpose of visually documenting the journey, however, will allow me to focus on the transitions and changes, no matter how minor.Most of the drawings will be black pen on paper. For some, however, I'll use other media such as colored ink or acrylics.Œæ"

I sell my work through my site,Œæhadleyhutton.com, in my etsy shop,Œæhadleyhutton.etsy.com, and in shops across theŒæglobe.I have had great success with my products. They have been featured in popular publications and blogs such as, Martha Stewart Living, Lucky, Sunset, Real Simple, andŒæDesign Sponge, to name a few.I love creating functional every objects that are beautiful! This love provided the inspiration for my line of sticky note cubes, and note pads. NotŒæonly do the cubes and pads provide a utilitarian function, but they are adorned with captivating art that will enliven any desk. The products make wonderful gifts as well.ŒæWhy Kickstarter?The majority of my work is created on demand, eliminating the need for high overhead costs. For example, I get an order for a hadley hutton print, then I print it out on my archival printer, and ship it. Yet with my latest project I am unable to print the product on my personal printer. The project involves working with aŒæprofessional offset printer to create sticky note cubes, and note pads made with 100% recycled paper and soy-based ink. The printer requires a large minimum quantity of piecesŒæprinted per design. Recycled paper increases the expense. Due to these high upfront costs, I need your help to get this project up and running.The funds will purchase printing for 2 sticky note cube design editions made with soy based inks and 100%Œærecycled paper, and 4 notepad design editions (two grocery magnetic, and two office memo) made with recycled paper and soy inks. Any funds raised past my targetŒæamount will be used to print additional designs of sticky note cubes and notepads, or to upgrade to larger paper cubes.

1380," There is an abundance of subjects around this ""Great Lake"" and I would like to try to capture the 24 most interesting of them in classic black & white fashion using the meticulous pen & ink process called ""pointillism"" or ""stipple"", this is the practice of creating an entire illustration with single points of ink. This technique takes an incredible amount of time for each indivdual illustration, thus requiring a massive committment to complete an entire series. Of the 24 pieces in the series, I plan on doing 8-8""x10""s, 8-11""x14""s, 8-16""x20""s, an 8""x10"" piece done using this style of drawing takes approximately 2 weeks, an 11""x14"" piece takes approximately 4 weeks and a 16""x20"" takes about 8 weeks, thus to complete a project of this scale, I plan on it taking over two years.The first phase of the project would be to tour Lake Superior's entire circumfrance, taking hundreds of photos of all the potential subjects. Then I will pick out the 24 most interesting subjects that best represent all aspects, man made and natural, of Lake Superior.ŒæOnce the subjects are chosen the long process of putting ink on paper begins! People will be able to follow my progress at:RCIllustration.comTo facilitate the entire project, I will need a minimum of approximately $10,000 to cover travel, equipment, supplies, and time. The funds will also go towards publishing a ""coffee table"" type of book of the entire project, documenting it from sart to finish, including; photos (which weren't used in the project) and various scenes of creating the drawings."

1385," The focus of the artwork is based on Pug dogs, mainly our own pug named Pugsly. We've created a facebook page for the Pugsly Sticker Co. and it has been well received. We do not sell the stickers, we do charge a nominal fee if we have to ship via USPS. Normally we give them out to kids at local skate parks, skaters love adorning their skateboards with interesting stickers. We've gotten artwork for the last two stickers from some very talented artists and are looking for more. We would like funding to pay for the creation of more colorful and larger stickers, currently only small B&W are available."

1387," Birds of a Whimsical FeatherŒæby artist and illustrator LEX CovatoThis is a year long project in which I will create quirky Birdie illustrations and share them with kickstarter donors and the general public. ŒæBirdie is a name for a group of bird based characters which I have been illustrating with in the past 6 months to a year. ŒæAs an illustrator I enjoy telling stories through my paintings. ŒæMy paintings are odd, humorous, and often carry deep commentary. ŒæBirdie is a simplistic character yet acts as the perfect vehicle for relating to audiences and expressing ideas. ŒæI would like to do two things with Birdie and this project: 1. let Birdie evolve and explore it's range and potential 2. start a monthly art subscription bringing art into the homes and offices of larger audiences. ŒæAn art subscription would work like a magazine subscription. ŒæPeople would know the basis of the subscription but be surprised with something brand new each month. ŒæThis would allow more people to collect limited edition art, narrow the gap between the ""gallery goer"" and the general public, and simply give collectors something to look forward to each month.I will paint feverishly each month and select the most interesting of the Birdie creations to turn into an archival print. ŒæThose who support the project can follow it on my blog. ŒæThe images will eventually make their way to my website and to my tent in festivals. ŒæIf a donor subscribes to 6 or 12 months they will receive the 1st edition run of the print of the month. ŒæJust like buying a vinyl toy or trading cards it will be an exciting surprise to open the package you receive in the mail. ŒæAll prints are archival and signed which will give subscribers a start on collecting and investing in art.ŒæThe donated money go to:ŒæMaterials such as watercolors, ink, acrylic, illustration board, watercolor paper, wood, gesso, brushes, etc. ŒæŒæprinting costs- archival prints done by a print vendor with archival pigment and paper. ŒæCellophane print bags and foam-core backing.PackagingNOTE: keep your eye on this page for additional pledge level rewards. ŒæI will have a few that will be released as the donation level rises."
1388," For the past 10+ years I've been studying and depicting native west coast plant life, with the resultant artwork appearing on useful paper stationery items and fabric goods. Two years ago I began incorporating animals in my work and studying & depicting the ecosystems in which they live. I call this series Anima.ŒæWith this Kickstarter campaign, I hope to create my own Anima artist-in-residence program and travel throughout the Pacific Northwest for two months in order to continue my investigation and depiction of the native flora and fauna of our region, without the daily constraints and distractions in my studio!ŒæThe tour will result in a collection of 6 - 8 new Anima posters and notecards, available mid-November exclusively for project supporters. Just in time for holiday gift-giving!As an eco-concious artist and designer, I'm really excited about the idea of Kickstarter - pitching a project that becomes a reality only if there's enough financial support for it - and I'm working to transition all my physical goods-making to this type of pay-before-it's-made model. Already my sewn goods are made-to-order, and now, with this Kickstarter campaign,Œæ I'm investigating ways to do the same with my paper printed goods. The standard ""make something and then see if it sells"" model we've all been using is such a waste of time, money and resources!Where will you go on your tour?ŒæWell, I have a few ideas about which animals I'd like to learn more about, and the national parks and natural areas I'd like to spend time in. Sponsors above the $100 donation level will have a chance to vote and decide exactly which animals and ecosystems will be a part of the new Anima collection.There will also be frequent updates on my travels and investigations for all project sponsors.What will you use the money for?The money raised here will go towards gas and car maintenance, food & lodging, and the 1st run of new Anima posters and notecards which will be available exclusively to project sponsors for the 2011 holiday season!ŒæTell me more about those posters and notecards!All are printed on post-consumer recycled paper with soy-based inks by my favorite family-owned print shop here in Portland, Oregon.Œæ The shop and I have devised a meticulous 5-color process that ensures accurate reproduction of the vibrant colors I use in my original drawings.Posters are sized to fit in a standard 16"" by 20"" frame.

1390," I'm going to create a limited run serigraph of the crucifixion called ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit"". It's in chiaroscuro, with red ink representing the nails and spear hole. The run will be on white cotton rag paper approximately 20 by 30 inches. The black aspect of the print will be done at a local printer, and then the red will be individually hand painted on each print by myself (and whomever I can get to help me).Here's a prototype of the image:I'm Catholic, so of course I've grown up around religious art, and have long been fascinated by it. I studied religious art in college as well, which deepened my appreciation for the symbolism and complexity in many pieces. A few years ago I created this image as a Christmas gift for my parents. They had it framed, and I was struck by how beautiful it looked and since then have wanted to do a large print run. I've only been held back by a lack of resources.The major costs are buying and shipping the rag paper and paying for the printing and trimming of the artwork. I look forward to working with you to make this project happen!"

1392," Breaking the Chain: Often overlooked and forgotten, weäó»re here to help recognize the unseen victims of crime: the children and families left behind by the individuals incarcerated. Through art, inspiration and donations of prisoners, we help give back to the community.ConsInk offers a promising solution to the often controversial & questionable dilemma posed by the selling of prison art for profit. We recognize that while there are remarkable artists sharing their work from behind bars, the community often sees this as a slap in the face to the victims of crime. Through the creative arts, prisoners often find new ways to develop their ability to express themselves and imagine alternate scenarios.We work with outreach programs to ensure the ongoing creative arts in prisons, while offering a way to give back to the community.Even in the harsh environment of prison, trust and community build. Prisoners can undergo a profound transformation, which helps them make better choices in life, inside and outside of prison. Our goal is to help them help the community from behind bars.Our mission is to offer back to the victims of crime, particularly those who are often forgotten äóñthe families and children of prisoners. By sharing incredible works of art compiled from various sources and contributing to organizations and outreach groups who support the victims of crime, we feel that we are doing our part to help others give a little bit back to the community.We offer T-Shirts, Prints and Printed Canvas of amazing works of art donated or offered to us in the hopes that those less fortunate can in fact benefit from their exposure.

1393," When I was a child, a neighbor used to send out multi-page Christmas cards that included holiday tales like the story of the three Wise Men. Following in this tradition, I am creating a mailable card that includes the Tolstoi short fable ""Three Questions,"" illustrated with five linocuts.I began planning this project in November of 2009; being short on both time and funds meant the project stayed on the drawing board until now. You can see my original idea here. In addition, you can follow the project's day-to-day progress, see the prototypes that do (and don't!) work, early sketches, prints, and so forth by following my blog."
1394," So Far this has been one heck of a Journey. The artist (MyronChristian) and the rest of our team are trying to do it ALL. So we have created and self- published his first coffee table book of an 8 year spiritual journey. Where every trip always felt like his last. All these experiences and exchanges bear an inexplicable physical, emotional, and spiritual toll. Imagine the difficulty of being so far out there. So far removed from your own material reality, that you are confronted by the Truth of it all. Face to face with the very essence of your own existence- hyper aware of your mortality. Because in those moments there is very little room for trying to evaluate strength and possibly overestimating your personal limitations. But every few months or so, another cryptic dream filled with the quixotic, and MyronChristian would find himself packing equipment bags in preparation for the mystery ahead. www.modernmaninsearchofsoul.comSo here we are in phase 2 - we are raising funds to create a mind blowing exhibition from the collection entitled Modern Man in Search of Soul. By taking select Limited Edition pieces from the work, we are going to create an awe-inspiring, jaw dropping visceral experience. Through this never before seen take on the lives of indigenous tribesmen and women, shamans, elders and warriors, follow the visionary quest of MyronChristian as you journey back to your own true Self. And all that truly is.We would like to create a Cave Labyrinth experience of the journey. But, in this Labyrinth's end you will not encounter the proverbial Minotaur - the end is the beginning. For only when you reach an ending can you truly begin; and it is there that one finds all things are illuminated. The money contributed will be used for the structure, and printing of large format prints (40""x60"" and larger- of which approximately 20 will be created), all the whilst mixing passage walls with quotes from his book. So the final hard costs consist of materials needed to create this ethereal presentation which we imagine will bring a sense of hope and levity in these trying times.THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP! We need quite a bit more than our goal, but any help at all is appreciated. Any additional funds will go toward helping this story reach the widest audience possible!!!"
1395," The project is for me to draw three things as a single piece of art, that are framed separately. They are individually larger than anything I have done on paper. The center drawing will be square, displayed at an angle like a diamond, flanked by two rectangular drawings. The drawings are to be of a checkerboard like pattern, I have used this on a few drawings in the past, the pattern will have two colors and with in the pattern stars. I hope the three pieces will visit more then a few galleries. Each drawing will have a different pattern and a different star design. I need quality paper and makers. Paper and markers I have used in the past have yellowed and faded. Plus these drawings are huge, the single is 36x36 and the other 2 are 24x48. I have a wall at my place that I will use to tape the paper up and have at it, one by one. Get a pro to take pictures of them so that I can get half size prints and t-shirts of the drawings made. Then have them matted and framed by a pro down the street from a place I used to work. Then display them first at the place I used to work, then at more then a few galleries, I hope as many as possible."
1396," I began working on this pen & ink drawing is 1977. Worked on it on and off for years. Reworked it again earlier this year. Having spent around 300 hours drawing I am now satisfied with the black & white version! The drawing ""Castles Made of Sand"" was created with black india ink and white ink using a croquille pen on paper. Croquille pens create the finest of lines. For the fine line technique used this is a rather large drawing of 18"" x 24"".Now I am trying to convert the black and white ""Castles Made of Sand"" drawing to color using Photoshop.Where I'm at:I have scanned the image in 6 sections at 1800dpi. I now need to assemble the 6 sections to make one flat image. Convert the image to RGB and colorize it. In the past I have made a high contrast film (lithography film) print and colored it by hand using watercolor. Those are mediocre. Much of the line work was either lost or became fatter and thus looked clumped together.It is very difficult to view the fine lines on small internet images. Enlarged sections are located here:http://www.midairstudio.com/privatesale/castles01.jpghttp://www.midairstudio.com/privatesale/castles02.jpgRecent accolades:I was awarded first place for a charcoal drawing titled ""Wise Likeness"" in the August Art Show at the Dodge Pratt Northam Art and Community Center, 106 Schuyler St., Boonville, NY. I exhibited an original watercolor painting titled ""Moment of Seclusion"" and this pen and ink drawing ""Castles Made of Sand"" in the Arts and Home Center at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, NY. ""Castles Made of Sand"" won 3rd place in Fine Arts Division A - Professional Class / Graphics. ""Moment of Seclusion"" won Honorable Mention in Fine Arts Division C - Professional Wildlife Art Class / Paintings. To date no business has come out of these efforts.I am requesting for the Kickstarter community support because taking time to create quality art has placed my families well being in jeopardy. Unfortunately for me we cannot survive on praise and award ribbons. For many years business in central New York has been lousy for the arts. With no marketing capital to get my art in front of potential buyers, I have found myself being pulled towards the bankruptcy hole. There is no place to cut my overhead since I don't have payments for cable/dish tv, cell phone, car (I have a 1996 model), healthcare, or ""costly"" lifestyle.I want the Kickstarter community to decide if this is a worthwhile endeavor and fund my time and efforts on this project or if I need to hang up the art thing and find a ""real"" job. I thank you for reading this and your generous support."
1397," In what began as a series of harmless doodles at work, the Who's Who project is an ongoing project dedicated to chronicling every villain and foe from the hit TV show Doctor Who. Each character will be lovingly hand drawn, inked, and colored in appropriately. The project will culminate into one final piece - a large group shot of all of the various beasts, robots, henchmen, other ne'er do wells. Encompassing over 40 years of history, this piece will consist of over 100 individual pieces in the end.At this point, the project is more of a personal one to help build my portfolio (as well as spread some Doctor Who love) but I'm interested in putting the finished piece on posters, playing cards, and more as the demand arises. Recently, my six year old iMac has begun to die so the money will be going towards the purchase of a new computer, tablet pad, scanner, and some minor art supplies. Unfortunately, with my current income I have no way of affording any of this so I'm looking for any help I can get, especially from fellow Who fans and those of you looking to support a struggling artist. More of my work can be found at http://jaktheterrible.deviantart.com/Thanks for reading and have a great day!"

Please be a part of this ambitious project and earn some one-of a kind rewards!"
1399," äóÖHeartlandäó» will be a four part multimedia exhibition about the awareness and preservation of the human heart.Over two days I had two very powerful yet different experiences. I read an article that said in one year, 1 million Americans will have a heart attack, the population of Dublin is approximately 1 million.Later in conversation, a friend spoke about the food industry in America and how, over 30,000 artificial food products are introduced into supermarkets every year. I felt compelled to say something about these two experiences, the state of our hearts and how delicate we are as human beings. They are after all our engine room. It becomes even more evident to me how mortal we really are and it made me question the quality of our self-preservation.Like the chambers of a heart, Heartland will be a multi-visual art exhibition broken into four elements - photography, mixed media paintings, video installation and scultpture. äóÖHeartlandäó» will also involve my own heart since I am a smoker and a drinker. I will film an Echocardiagram of my own heart in a hospital and document the results for use in video-installation part of äóÖHeartlandäó».Sculpture:4 rows of 10 pigs hearts per row will be set into 2 glass containers. Each heart will be anchored in place. The hearts will be submerged in isopropyl alcohol for lifelong preservation. The toughened glass containers will be hermetically sealed, underlit with a light box and designed to be set into a low lying rosewood coffee table.Photography:4 photographs of a single hearts will be produced in a sepia tone. One will be crowned with thorns. One will have a brass lock embedded in the front wall of the heart with a key protruding from it. Another will have a cigarette lying beside a heart and another photograph of a heart revealing the inner workings of a clock embedded inside the four chambers. Each photograph will be limited to an edition of 25 each.Mixed Media Paintings:a) Three mixed media paintings of two hearts side by side. They will vary in size from A4 - A1. Each painting will be printed onto etching paper and finished adding oil, beeswax, Indian ink, varnish and fine sand.b) A triptych of two hearts together with differing coloring formations. These will also be printed onto etching paper and finished adding oil, beeswax, Indian ink, varnish and fine sand.c) A canvass (4.5ft x 3.5ft) containing thinly cut slivers of a complete pigs heart laid out onto the canvas in a very uniform manner and covered with a thin coat of varnish.Each painting will be limited to an edition of 25 each.Video Installation:2 X looping Hi-definition video projections -Film 1: We see a heart with a key protruding from itäó»s side. A hand winds the key. As we hear the sound of a clock ticking, we see the aorta begin to throb and the insides of the heart become illuminated. Ultimately the sound of the clock eventually slows down, the inner illumination of the heart fades, the pumping aorta slows until eventually everything stops.Film 2: A filmed Echocardiagram of my own heart will be looped into a kind of time-lapse movie. The audio and visual footage of my heartbeat will regulate and alternate intermittently so that the viewers own heart rate will be affected by my own heartbeat as it increases to an insane speed and then slows down to a gradual crawl and eventual stop.Some Important Things To Think About:Every year, more than 1 million Americans have a heart attack äóñ a sudden interruption in the heart's blood supply.Women don't always feel chest pain with a heart attack. Women are more likely than men to have heartburn, loss of appetite, tiredness or weakness, coughing, and heart flutters.Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for half of all heart disease deaths in the U.S., but it's not the same as a heart attack. SCD occurs when the heart's electrical system goes haywire, causing it to beat irregularly and dangerously fast.Men have a higher risk of having a heart attack than women, and at an earlier age. But it's important to note that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, too.High cholesterol and high blood pressure are major risk factors for heart disease. Being overweight, obese, or physically inactive all increase your risk. So does diabetes, especially if your glucose levels are not well controlled.Each year in the U.S., more than 135,000 people die from smoking-related heart disease.It is possible to regain your health after a heart attack. By avoiding cigarettes, becoming more active, and watching what you eat, you can give your heart and overall health a big boost.The key to preventing heart disease is a healthy lifestyle. This includes a nutritious diet, at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, not smoking, and controlling high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation äóñ no more than one drink a day for women, two drinks a day for men.What you eat makes a difference. Be sure you get plenty of whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits to help keep your heart healthy. Plant oils, walnuts, other nuts, and seeds can also help improve cholesterol levels. And don't forget to eat fish at least a couple of times each week for a good source of heart-healthy protein."
1400," For February, the month of love, I presenting the local art community with a special three hour figure drawing session. I'm calling it ""Bonds of Love"" and for this session, the art models will pose nude while tied in shibari inspired rope bondage.Shibari (literally means ""to tie"" or ""to bind) is the Japanese art of tying a subject that focuses on not only immobilizing them, but doing so in an elegant and beautiful fashion. This creates an intimate and erotic experience for both the subject and the person tying or rigger.I want to be able to bring this unique type of intimacy to the art community in the form of classical figure drawing. This exposes artists to the art of shibari, normally inaccessible, and to capture this artistry in sketches and paintings. Local artists will come together, connect, share, and create as two lovely models in elaborate rope ties pose just inches from their pads & pencils.Hiring a single art model can be quite expensive especially on a young artist's budget. And for this session, I have to pay two models, so each model has time to rest between poses. I also have to hire a professional to come tie the ropes. So I need some help, $300 worth of help to pay the artists involved. The support of your donations goes directly to the lovely models and the professional rigger that is driving down from LA to make this session possible.Thank you in advance for your support of my program, artists, and art models.Konstant <|3"
1401," I create lifesize kaji-style wall illustrations/scenery out of fabric, marrying folk art, pop art and environmental design into an interactive story whereas the visitor feels they have stepped into an alternate dimension; a very plush, yet sinister cartoon. For about two years now I have been, piece by piece, handstitching together a fabric world that I call ""Broken Velcroe Land"". It is essentially a lifesize interpretation of an unseen dimension of archons created by you and I through mantras we unknowingly repeat in our everyday lives. Because I am a songwriter as well as a scene-stress, I think about this much when I am writing. How often do we actually think about the effect words and verses we repeat aloud and their unseen effects on our lives and the world? The 20 inhabitants, or, archons, are cheeky incarnations of my own bad habits, such as ""the cowardly rooster"" the ""bad idea bug"" and the ""melve of mess"" (who has pictures of my messy house printed inside his cape and enjoys standing on top of lost keys in the morning when you are late for work).My goal right now is to complete the two remaining walls of four to complete the 4D environment of fabric backdrops, pillows and plushies for a March hanging and theatrical residency at a popular Los Angeles gallery / community performance space. I have 70% of the environment completed and need funds for fabric, time, and to pay some starving musicians to help me hand-stitch so that I may complete the scenery in time. Because all of the pieces belong to one set, they are not for sale and this will and always has been more or less be a grandois labor of love, so thank you very much for your interest and support!"
1402," The Project:  äóìthatäó»s a whole lot of babies in one room...äó is what I hope will be said once this project is completed.I have found the perfect room here in Berlin, Germany to do a massive Urban Art Project. The idea for this project is to wheat paste one of my drawings; a baby I did after coming back from a trip to Japan. With this drawing of a baby, I plan on covering the ceiling and three of the walls to the floor in the room.While installing this Urban Art Project I will be documenting the whole process in order to make a zine about the project and a short film.*As a bonus - I will also make a äóìTreasure Mapäó that will be given to contributors to find this room full of babies.    The Plan:  After this project is fully funded by your contribution; the first step will be to make enough babies to cover the ceiling and three walls. With the square footage of the room - it will take roughly 1,200 - 1,400 to cover all the surface area.Once the Babies are made, and ready to be pasted on the walls. It will be time to start installing this Urban Art Project. The goal is to have the room completed and installed withing 3 - 4 days.Meanwhile with the installing, there will be filming and documenting the whole project. After the installation is complete work will begin on the Zine and the Short Film.Once this is completed, it will be all distributor to the contributors that helped this project along with the äóìTreasure Mapäó to see this room in person.

It's 32 pages of creatures, haunts and spooks for you to color and enjoy.It takes money to print, bind and ship these books, so I need your help! Simply buying a coloring book, or choosing from the list of rewards is all you need to do to make this happen."
1404," These days it seems that there is bad news everywhere you turn. Oil spills, war, global warming, and the terrible economy are all enough to squish what little hope a person can have in a day. I've made it my personal mission to get the world to laugh in the face of bad news. For the past year I have been creating Doomsday Survival Kits that are customized to fit an individual or situation. Here are some examples:DIY Build Your Own Bunker! äóÂThis is a video that shows a person digging a hole that is six feet long by three feet wide and two feet deep. When the hole is dug the person is shown getting into a mylar body bag and lying down in the hole. Daisy's have been planted in the same plot of space.Doomsday Device! äóÂThe Doomsday Device is a small black plastic box with metal hinges. When the box is opened there is a toggle switch that reads ""ON"" and ""ON"" (no off option) that has been set in a plexiglass sheet. Under the plexiglass sheet there are red, black yellow and green wires running from the toggle switch to the back of the box.How do your pledges help? I have created many survival kits and would like to create more including the construction of a kiosk where these kits can all be sold. Not only will you get your own snarky kit, but you'll be helping to create a permanent space for the Doomsday Project!"
1405," This summer, I am entering the print studio again for a new and exciting project. This art print will be about cycling and Europe and will be featured in an upcoming exhibit that will promote and connect the local cycling community with the European cycling community.I invite the Kickstarter community to participate by funding my studio costs and receiving an inside look into the process and progress of this art print. Backers will also receive a signed edition of the final art print.I'm thrilled to be included in this exhibit and am eager to get started. If you are not familiar with my work, here are links to my portfolio and blog.http://jamesobrien.us/portfoliohttp://jamesobrien.us/blogI'm thinking about a portrait of a cyclist, a view from a low-angle, showing the intensity in his face, fierce, fury, driven, his grimacing face lowered to the handlebars, close to the wheel, struggling up hill. I'll post initial sketches soon."
1406," What are we doing you cry?We're sending letters to everyone in the world, one town at a time.We're trying to prompt chats around neighborhoods. (Not boring! Exciting!)We're trying to spread a bit of butter! (Joy.)We're lighting the long weird wick of community curiosity and waiting for it to do whatever that particular mix of people does. (Who knows?!)What sort of thing should strangers say to strangers?Who absolutely hates letters?What will come for you in the mail tomorrow?Thanks to the brilliant people who pledged on here last time we wrote over 600 letters to every home in Polish Hill in Pittsburgh in America...Now we want to go further, quicker, bigger, thinner, taller, shorter, etc.(6,825,898,913 x better)Will you help?Yes?No?Join us! It's free! (not free)(This time we're looking to raise $8000 for travel to a very remote (secret at the moment, sorry) location. Until now we've had to limit our letter writing to 620, the most we can do in two weeks without dying, but with $8,000 we can write to hundreds and hundreds more people, longer letters, further travels, whole cities, etc.)"
1407," The Brooklyn Hi Art Machine began as two artist that have been living in the same Brooklyn building for the past 12 years, last summer we began having drawing and sewing nights. This summer we would like to extend our art making to our community by creating a free arts program that would take place on our block 3 days a week, 4 hours a day for a period of 3 weeks.During these art workshops there will be individual projects that participants can take home as well as a collaborative project that everyone can contribute to that will focus on issues that are important to our neighborhood, that will later be displayed publicly and celebrated at the end of the free art workshop series.As artist, we began these evenings of art making with the intention of building a closer relationship as neighbors. We believe that bringing this practice to the rest of our community will allow us to act as a bridge between our neighbors and the various cultural institutions that exist in our community but have fallen short when it comes to engaging local residents.Our goals are to create a greater connection between neighbors in our communityand make art friendly and accessible to all.We believe that by becoming active ,collective participants in art making, members of the community can find new ways to relate to each other and to the art institutions in the neighborhood.We will use the money raised on Kickstarter for art supplies, equipment such as tables, chairs, a sun canopy; healthy snacks and way way cool t-shirts featuring original artwork for our participants."
1408," 4000 Years for Choice (http://www.4000yearsforchoice.com) develops visual narratives about the practices of contraception and abortion from around the world over the past 4000 years. The project aims to celebrate, inspire, and empower women and men in their reproductive lives!This project responds directly to 40 Days for Life campaign (http://www.40daysforlife.com), an anti-choice movement targeting women's health clinics through 40-days of prayer and fasting in front of clinics across the counry. Therefore, I decided to create a project that focuses on these same clinics through a national postcard mailing campaign.So far, I have personally ""kickstarted"" the project with my own funding by sending seven postcards to approximately 180 clinics (those targeted by the 40 Days campaign.)The feedback has been phenomenal! Abortion providers, nurses, college professors, and pro-choice supporters have emailed saying thank you for this amazing project!Check out the comments and press...http://4000yearsforchoice.com/4000/category/comments/http://4000yearsforchoice.com/4000/category/press/Specifically, funding will be used to continue this project. I will print and mail one postcard per week to approximately 200 clinics for 52 weeks. All of the designs are finished, it's just a matter of printing and mailing!Here's the budget...200 printed postcards ($34.42 per week) x 52 weeks = $1789.84200 stamps ($56 per week) x 52 weeks = $2912.00Total project cost = $4701.84The history of contraception and abortion is transformative, healing, and brings a much needed historical context to the pro-choice landscape. These postcards are just one way to let clinics know they are following a tradition that dates back thousands of years.I hope you will support my project!"
1409," As a professional artist/oil painter and an amateur vegan cook I have been looking for a way to use my art to promote a healthy, sustainable and compassionate lifestyle. My solution is to create a series of postcard sized, illustrated vegan recipe cards.How the project will work:I will begin the series using recipes that I have gathered through the years. I will prepare the food, set up a still-life using the meal, execute a painting of the still-life and photograph the painting for the front of the recipe card. On the back will be simple instructions on how to prepare the dish. Once project is up and running I will use recipes provided by backers. I am asking all backers who are inclined to submit 1 recipe that they want to share with the world and I will include it in my series. All backers who submit a recipe will be credited with a byline on their card. I am aiming toward a minimum of 25 cards. The maximum is dependent upon funding.Once the project is complete the cards will be printed and distributed to backers based on the rewards system described. The idea is that everyone involved will share and distribute these cards to friends, family, strangers, businesses, etc. in an effort to spark dialogue about the importance of steering toward more humane and environmentally sustainable eating habits. I feel the best way to accomplish this is to demonstrate that vegan food can be absolutely delicious and satisfying as opposed to an act of culinary deprivation and I want these recipes to prove it.What to consider when donating a recipe:1) It tastes fantastic; something with which non-vegans would have a hard time finding fault.2) something that is not too complex; remember it has to fit on the back of a postcard and the print must be legible.3) keep these categories in mind: easing into vegan, international dishes, traditional breakfast turned vegan, soups, desserts. these are just a few to get you thinking.What the funding is for:Funding for this project goes toward the following:- art materials; the paint, canvas, etc.- printing costs, full color illustration on the front, recipe on the back- artist feeFor examples of my artwork and credentials check out: http://www.edmondpraybe.comand feel free to email me with any questions."
1410," I am an artist with a disability, and im currently trying to raise enough funds to cover the costs of framing work for a showing of mouth drawings i will be doing this september. I was born with a condition called arthrogryposis , this disability prevents me from holding a pencil or pen with my hands and because of this i have developed the ability to draw with my mouth.I was recently offered a show in louisville ky, the show will take place in september of this year and will consist of 10 twenty by thirty inch drawings done on water colour and print making paper. each of these drawings take roughly 3 days to construct, and i currently have 7 of the 10 ready to frame. I plan to mount the drawings and then frame them in a simple light wood frame. each one of these works will cost roughly 150 dollars each to frame, and the gallery i will be showing the work at cannot afford to give me financial assistance.The reason im trying to raise the funds on kickstarter is that i am currently on a fixed income, and because of the short notice [ i only have 2 months ] i do not have enough time to slowly raise the funds myself.If you can't give alot....then give a little, because every bit helps.you can see past works of mine here - http://thanielionlee.com/sd09.html and here - http://www.flickr.com/photos/thaniellee/sets/72157622805167449/more information about my disability can be see here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis"
1411," Since the first ever ""Drawing Day"" -- the one day in the year when everyone around the world tries taking some time off to draw something, to try to achieve 1 million drawings drawn that day, globally -- I've held these 24-hour nonstop drawing marathons, where I drew nonstop for the whole 24 hours, other than a few biobreaks (2008, 2009). I drew what came to mind in this weird stream of consciousness that gets at you when you haven't slept for 36+ hours (hyping and PR-ing the event, the day before, then the entire day drawing)... and, I also took requests -- I drew whatever *anyone* requested. It's the one day in a year that I truly feel like I'm myself, and yet...I wasn't able to participate this year largely due to my Wacom Intuos 2 failing just days before the vigil. Reality; I took that as a divine sign (yet another one) that drawing and art isn't for me.I can't say I'm a successful artist, per se -- at least, not in the standards capitalism would hold me to. Despite being a full time artist for the past one sixth of my life, I've managed to fail at every single grant opportunity I've tried at (rejection, rejection, rejection! :-()... Economically, I'm a starving artist -- but energetically and spiritually, I'm a devoted zealot of art.Earlier this week, after some tinkering, I fixed my tablet and... I want to draw, draw, draw, nonstop... It's like my old long-lost best friend has risen from the dead -- in the style that I can do numbers in, yet still express ideas, convey the human story in -- sketches via the Wacom pad, my art in black and white.So, here we go... please help support me in my way-too-idealistic-and-a-tad-bit-crazy project. I'd need the entire month off to be able to draw non-stop, to live an entire 30 days, to be able to just exist, and do what I do as an artist. The minimal cost of that is 3k - I live in California, so that'd barely cover rent, plus a small stipend for groceries. For me, being able to raise that just for my art would mean so much -- it'd even *feel* like a miracle! Not to mention, this is also your chance to get *cheap* but chic custom art!We have the entire month of August to raise the funds for my crazy dream -- Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing deal. If we reach our goal, I'm drawing non-stop from September 1 to September 30! Send in your requests digitally - and I'll email you your drawing - you can be anywhere in the world! You'd get your drawing's worth!Please let me draw!!!"
1412," The Last Supper is a two-week long affair, with a celebration, charity benefit, and arts exhibition that showcases local emerging art, film, music, new media, and culinary talents. Now in our sixth year, weäó»ve grown from a backyard party celebrating the end of Summer to an indoor-outdoor feast, concert, and exhibition at Brooklynäó»s Third Ward with 800+ attendees. We are a community-based event, supporting local artists and local food producers.Each year we choose a theme dealing with consumption for our artists, musicians, and chefs to pursue. This yearäó»s theme is self-made, referencing how communities and individuals define, create, and provide identity for themselvesäóîwhether it be through DIY movements, online personas and avatars, community collaborations, or individuals relocating and starting new lives.This year, we plan on expanding the scope of The Last Supper further, to include community events such as lectures and interactive workshops. Your donation will support these events, as well as our annual opening-night party, showcasing food, art, and music from emerging talents, which benefits the Food Bank of New York City.Your donation helps us cover necessary set up fees for the festival and opening night event, including food, event space, and production costs (equipment rentals, hanging art)."
1413," My name is Paul Gaj. I am a graphic designer, illustrator and artist who lives and works in Groton, Massachusetts. Many people throughout the country have been appalled by the economic and ecological devastation in the Gulf brought on by the tragic oil spill. We all want to help in some way, but as the leak is capped, the focus and interest from the rest of the country will also begin to dissipate, but for an incidental update on the evening news.I have spent a good portion of my career painting the seascapes and waterways of New England. I can only imagine how awful it would feel to walk along tar-bathed sands on Cape Cod and not be able to enjoy the seafood that provides both livelihood and nourishment or the pristine coves and marshes that have inspired decades of artists and visitors here.I would like to document the immediate transformation of the Gulf in the wake of the spill through my watercolors (what more appropriate medium), photographs, sketches and brief conversations with residents over a three week period and compile my observations into a book and exhibition titled äóìEye on the Gulf Coast. The View From a New England Artistäó.I intend to use my own vehicle with all the necessities and travel from Boston to Pensacola, Florida. From there I will make my way west to Venice, Louisiana and back to Pensacola. I plan to split the trip along the coast so that I can hit a few areas I may have missed on my return. Mind you, this is also hurricane season and I will be taking every precaution. I will be traveling alone and away from my family (Whose full support I have). I donäó»t consider this a paid vacation.I am not trying to profit from the tragedy of others. The purpose of this project is twofold. One is that as much as I and others in the Northeast and other parts of this country would like to, we cannot go down there and scrub the oil off the rocks and birds nor donate large sums of money to assist the effort. Two, is that as an artist, I not only want my work to say something about what I see, I want it to do something. Have an effect. Make an impression beyond a mere image and to generate additional publicity and support for the Gulf coast.I will not be making an evil corporation or political issue out of this. There are plenty of people and organizations out there doing that already. If anything, I am looking to become more informed about the situation from my first hand experience, and I hope I can inform others and perhaps let the folks along the Gulf know that their tragedy is our tragedy and even though we are in New York or Minnesota they are our citizen brothers and we truly care and want to help.For more information please visit http://www.eyeonthegulfcoast.comor http://www.pgajdesign.com"
1414," We are a burning man theme camp made up of Santa Cruz artists, surfers, and hippies. Our dream is to offer free tie dye to the Burning Man community, white t-shirts and all. In the desert habitat of Burning Man we believe that our super bright, DIY tie dye will bring giggles and colorful creative zing to many dusty burners. Tie dye is raw artistic self-expression and for most of us it brings to mind peace signs and free-spirited adventures in rusty VW buses, two things our planet could use more of. Support our tie dye revolution!"
1415," I want to help a friend of mine who will be going to an event and wants to give out stickers in the form of a white/blank cartoon speak-bubble while he blows bubbles. By passing out the bubble sticker at the event (and to the public in general), the idea is to encourage people to place the sticker somewhere in a public space (or anywhere, how are we to stop such a thing?). Doing this may provoke someone else (or the same person who placed the sticker) to write something interesting into the bubble-space.We think more people should be part of creative urban expression to level the playing field currently imbalanced by excessive corporate advertisements. We want more citizens to claim their stake in public spaces.In order to give away stickers to donors, more funds are needed due to the minimum order size and shipping costs. This means that the project costs will cover printing (vinyl stickers) and shipping costs (to ship stickers to donors).Thank you for your time."

1418," Hello, and welcome to project Casa Artelexia. Who and what is Casa Artelexia??? I am Elexia and my father/business partner is Andres. One year ago, we started a family business importing artistic Mexican products. My father makes several trips a year to Mexico where he works with a group of artists and craftsmen from all parts of Mexico to create high-quality unique gifts, decor and furniture. We work very closely with the artists and strive to create working relationships that are beneficial to both. We pay the artists and craftsmen fair wages and try to keep our retail prices reasonable, passing the savings directly to you, our customer. Since March 2009, we have sold our products at various outdoor markets and have received tons of positive feedback on the quality and uniqueness of our products.Until now, our main retail venue has been the La Jolla Farmers' Market, where we have had great success. Most recently, we have started to sell our products at the wholesale level and we are currently in stores in New York, Colorado, Georgia, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, Washington and Oklahoma. We also have an online store at www.artelexia.com.Our next phase of the business is to open a retail store in downtown San Diego in order to help us bring Mexico's art and culture to you. We also aim to use the store's location as a ""cultural center"" for events and a meeting place for Mexican/Latino artists looking to promote their work. We believe in a close-knit community and hope to become a local leader in the Mexican and artist communities. We are working closely with local Hispanic cultural organizations in an effort to increase the public's knowledge of Mexico's rich history, culture and arts.As you know, the start-up costs for a small business can get quite expensive. In this economy, small business loans are next to impossible to secure. While we are investing our time, money and hearts into the next phase of Artelexia, we need your help to make this dream a reality. We have joined this fund-raising website in order for us to be able to reach out to you to ask for your much needed support. For every level of donation, there will be a äóìgiftäó from Artelexia as a thank you. You will also be able to follow our progress on this website, which will allow you to see your donation at work.Here is just one example of a series of events to be held at Casa Artelexia: Every 3rd Thursday of the month, Casa Artelexia will host a Loteria Fundraiser Fiesta. Guests will be charged a small fee to play and will win prizes. All monies raised will go towards various charities and organizations which share a common goal and vision with Casa Artelexia.If we can raise $10, 000 through your generous pledges, the funds will go towards a portion of our start-up costs, which will include:äó¢ painting the interior and exterior of the buildingäó¢ installing proper lightingäó¢ repaving the front stepsäó¢ supplies, such as cash register, counter, furniture, phones, bags, wrapping supplies,äó¢ insuranceäó¢ decoräó¢ landscaping the backyard, which will be made available to local artist events and hosting cultural meetingsäó¢ signageWe hope that you appreciate where we are going with Artelexia, follow along with our progress, tell a friend and contribute toward our goal of raising $10,000. All donations, regardless of amount, are greatly appreciated. This project truly means so much to us and we firmly believe that with your help we can make a difference. We thank you for your support."
1419," The ToonSeum is proud to present an exhibition featuring original art from the groundbreaking anime classic Akira.Katsuhiro Otomoäó»s anime masterpiece Akira is widely regarded as one of the most groundbreaking and influential films of all time. Based on the artistäó»s own landmark manga series of the same name, the film not only shattered box office records around the world but has retained a fiercely dedicated audience of animators and aficionados for more than twenty years äóñ and for good reason. Akira revolutionized animation and arguably saved the Japanese film industry, paving the way for a new generation of artists and spawning a worldwide acceptance of animation as high art.Akira was an epic collaboration and full of animation firsts. Adapted from thousands of pages of manga and pooling resources from several of Japanäó»s largest entertainment companies, the production cost over $10 million, which in 1988 made it the most expensive animated feature ever made. Akira was the first animated film in Japan to record its voice actoräó»s performances before principle animation began so that characteräó»s facial expressions and lip movements could be synchronized. An elaborate symphonic score was written and conducted by composer Shoji Yamashiro, a then unheard of indulgence that has become one of the most definable and enduring features of the film.No other film had ever looked like Akira, itäó»s stunningly fluid and detailed animation often requiring as many as nine separate cel layers. The 125 minute feature was comprised of over 160,000 cels and almost as many backgrounds, each one completely handäóñdrawn and hand-painted. Purists recognize Akira as the last completely hand-created animated feature, as cel animation quickly gave way to cheaper digital production and CGI technology.In 2010, the historical and artistic significance of Akira cannot be understated. As the popularity and influence of animation continues to expand, the Akira Exhibit gives audiences the unique opportunity to take a deeper look into this unparalleled achievement in filmmaking. Each item in the exhibit has been hand selected by Akira expert Joe Peacock from his unrivaled collection of more than 10, 000 authenticated pieces.Visitors will be given access to never-before-seen aspects of the film, from fully-displayed backgrounds, sketches and production development layouts, to the layers of cels that made up some of the most astounding scenes in the film.The Akira Exhibit promises to be an enthralling experience, sure to captivate any fan of animation and graphic storytelling, from anime enthusiast to those witnessing Otomoäó»s grand vision for the fist time.We are seeking public support to help present this remarkable exhibition. Your pledge helps pay for the cost of framing, marketing, and educational programing.Thank you."
1420," I am a Mexican-born graphic designer and visual artist who moved to New York after living for 12 years in San Diego. After leaving my art studio in sunny San Diego in time to experience the most frigid New York winter in a decade, I found myself feeling disoriented, overwhelmed, alienated, aloneäóîand unemployed. And, without the ability to relieve stress through riding my bike through the city, I had to look for another artistic and emotional outlet!I found this on the train one day, when absent-mindedly sketching figures in the subway with a chisel-tipped sharpie. Because of the fast pace of the city, I was forced to work quickly to capture the behaviors of unsuspecting passengers: sleeping, frantically playing video games or simply reading newspapers. When it got too cold, I would duck into a Starbucks to observe life both inside the cafí© and out the window onto the street.Basically, the product that I hope to create would be 100 bound monograph art books. The books would contain both word and image, and would document, through quick, gestural sketches and accompanying text, my exploration of New York City from an outsider's standpoint. As the cityäó»s inhabitants begin unpeeling layers of insulated clothing, they will also begin to metaphorically reveal themselves as the weather gets warmer. I will also capture the changes in nature as winter evolves into spring, then summer.To me the idea of sketching comes from the need to understand human complexity and its ever- changing environment. I want to capture the essence of New Yorkäó»s daily life. New York is a beautiful and inspiring city; I donäó»t wish to be confined to working in my apartment. I want to venture out and be embraced by the fast pace of the city so that I can translate it to my sketches.In order to complete this project, I'll need to purchase daily triple-espressos, monthly Metrocards, a bunch of Sharpies and sketchbooks, a digital camera, a MacBook laptop, as well as funding to produce self-promotional materials (postcards, business cards and stickers).Thanks in advance!-gErardo yEpiz"
1421," Project Mission Statement:""While working as a field organizer for Barack Obama's 2008 Presidential Campaign it struck me that there was a side of campaigning that is never known until you live it. Our staff was often lauded for our close-knitted-ness, our tenacity, and our dedication. The behind-the-scenes story only reinforces this perception.Days seemed like weeks and if someone had a desk next to yours then there was a 90% chance that they would become your best friend before the first coffee break was over. And there were moments that illustrated all of this. I began capturing these - just for posterity's sake in my sketchbook. As the moments added up and interest in how this collection of young kids with (largely) no prior experience pulled off an amazing electoral victory began building, I began to see these moments coalescing to tell a greater story.A collection of 300 drawings that illustrate what it was really like.The heartache, the unbelievable stress, and the moments when despite everything you laugh for half an hour because someone screwed up and a sex hotline number was printed on a state-wide absentee mailer. This is what campaign life is about: the moments.The specifics are my own, yet my story is everyone's story on this campaign. The incredibly inspiring call to service that prompted me to hop a bus to New Hampshire, driving from Ohio to Mississippi with just a backpack to my name, and working with the smartest people I'll ever know.Many books will be written that tell the story of the candidate, or the candidate's top advisors. But we were the foot soldiers right on the frontline. And in many states, we were the margin of victory.""THE PLAN:The book consists of 300 pen and ink drawings, as well as a running commentary throughout. 150 from the primaries (8 states) and 150 from the general. I am about 160 drawings into it.Each individual drawing takes about 6 hours to do, from conception to completion. You can imagine, with a day job as a campaign organizer, this time is hard to come by. And of course, in order for this book to be relevant, it needs to be completed as soon as possible. On a day off I can crank out 3 in a day. On a work day, I'm lucky to get a single one done.Without a job, I could finish this in 2 months.The goal of using Kickstarter as a funding platform is simple: Raise enough money to support myself for 2 months, sans day-job, get this thing done during those 2 months, and self-publish the first print.It seems very fitting to use a grassroots fundraising model for a project of this nature. In 2008 we used grassroots to get a man elected president. Surely in 2010, we can get a book published. :)I hope you'll consider donating to this project! There are some great items for each donation level to the side here, and I really can't do it without you!! Thanks!Also- please visit http://www.jennwhitcomb.com for a fun flash-filled glimpse into the making of this project, as well as more samples."
1422," Viral Linguistics is a collaboration between musician Honeybear and visual artist Heather Kai Smith. Heather makes drawings calling back to the innocent illustrations of the 1950's and 60's while inserting emotion, creating a contemporary context for the familiar style. Honeybear weaves honest and lonesome narratives while keeping sight of the light even when exploring ghostly soundscapes of experimental-folk music.The fruit of the project will be a 40 page notebook/sketchbook with 10 drawings of Heather's scattered amongst the pages. The cover will be drawn by Heather, then silkscreened and assembled by Honeybear. Included will be two download codes (one for the notebook's owner and one to give to a friend) for a 6-track collection of music by Honeybear.The funding will be put towards printing, paper, bindery supplies, silk-screening supplies, and mastering for the recorded tracks."
1423," An original collection that will include sketches, designs and writings (that are drawn) all in pen and ink. The book's format will be 8.5""x11"", hard back and of course printed in black and white. The collection will consist of at least one hundred fifty pages and I have half the content already. The work continues daily, so the number of pages may naturally grow. The content will be extremely varied. From abstract line work, detailed figures & form, process sketches, graphic art, drawn poems, text design, favorite quotes by friends, family and other notables all in a drawn format as well as anything else that flows from the well. Your generous backing will aid in necessary supplies such as archival ink, pens, bristol paper, fees for digitizing images, the purchase of ISBN number and of course the printing production of the book itself. I'd love to go larger in format, so if enough backing arrives that can happen too. Let's make this happen!"

1425," ""Return to Use""I am looking to build a tree structure completely out of recycled scrap metal. I am looking to keep a large majority of the pieces in their original form because I really want to show that, even in its original form, we can still use ""old junk"" for something and that is why it is called ""Return to Use"". The tree itself will be more of a fantasy design rather than reality and I plan to let my creativity go wild. Depending on donations, I want the tree to sand 12'-15' tall and 8'-10' wide. Along with the fantasy idea I am also going to use 200 LED lights, through out the project, to enhance the night features.I will be taking this piece to the 2010 Esthetic Evolution and my hopes are to also take it to the 2010 Burning Man event. The Esthetic Evolution (EE) is going to be held on June 17th-20th near Boise, ID and Burning Man is held in the Black Rock desert in Nevada at the end of August. I am looking for donations to complete the project before EE and additional funds to transport it to Burning Man. 100% of the donations will either go into the project or to the transportation of the art piece. Once everything is over, if their are any remaining donations I will invest those into another project on Kickstarter."

Legend has it that Indian Nick was created by the early settlers of America, a hybrid Indian (Half Indian, Half European decent). Their intent was to utilize his skills and local knowledge to show them where all the good soil was for farming. Colonization began, and Indian Nick was the middle man, genocide or assimilation... the end goal. They gave him a bible and a horse when he left camp in the Spring of 1774, unfortunately the settlers plan backfired, Indian Nick sided with his indigenous brothers and sisters & has since been spotted in numerous locations and political events such as The Revolutionary War, Removal Era Wars, Battle of Antelope Hills, The Dakota War, The Black Hills War, The Battle of Powder River, Yakima War, Battle of Little Bighorn, Wounded Knee, The occupation of Alcatraz Island, Trail of Broken Treaties march, Takeover of DAM etc. If you happen to see Indian Nick, please notify authorities as he has several warrants for his arrest spanning across many old and new territories & borders.Disclaimer*(the limited edition print is not the image shown)The work you will receive is Indigenous in contentPreview the some of this music herehttp://indiannick.bandcamp.com/releaseshttp://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2010/05/31/the-digital-indigenous"

1432," I am a former New York police forensic artist drawing 64 facial images of composite friends. I'll then draw a series of composites from the composites; 32 drawings combining four faces each, 16 drawings combining eight faces each, and so on until finally there is one drawing derived from all 128 faces.I'm posting the drawings to my website as each one is completed. I'm using charcoal on Stonehenge paper, 8.5 x 11"". The first 64 people who sent in usable photos are included, and drawings are made in the order that the photos were received. From the initial set of 64, the original drawings will go to the friends of the people who sent in the photos - an experiment in gift economy. I began accepting submissions in November 2007 and filled up all the spots in May 2008. Participants include people from across the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, China, and beyond.I've filled all the photo entries for this project, but now I'm looking for some financial support to help bring it to completion. As of June 2009, 36 drawings are done and I've got 91 left to make.Kickstarter funds will help pay for materials (paper, charcoal pencils, fixative, frames), as well as BFF posters and books that I'd like to make. I plan to have a show of the drawings in the physical world when they are all completed, and then distribute the originals. Putting on the show will involve a variety of costs as well (shipping, signage, invitations, etc). Supporting the BFF project will help this all come to fruition.BFF has been featured on Boing Boing and in FHM Germany. I posted a walk-through tutorial video, ""How To Draw A BFF"", to YouTube, and it's included on this page as well.To be updated when new drawings are posted, subscribe to my RSS News feed, or follow me on twitter @shawnfeeney. Pledging even just $1 will get you a shout-out on my website. If you've got deeper pockets, I'll draw you a custom BFF-style composite of your very own. You can pledge even if the goal has been met. Many thanks!"
1433," Public schools are struggling to provide students with a well-rounded education. Due to lack of adequate funding, art and music programs are at the bottom of the list. I started the Bone for a Brush project to support The Center for Arts Education by raising funds for their mission to ensure arts education for every public student in NYC.It began with a sculpture created in November 2008. I worked for several months with the assistance of artist Ted Lawson of Prototype Inc. constructing a 7-foot tall pillar of 156 cast wishbones. During the exhibition, the sculpture was knocked over and lay in a pile of ruin. Distraught over the whole ordeal, I did nothing. After a few weeks of mourning I had an epiphany and transformed the event into an impetus to do something positive and contribute to something I believe in: I would sell pieces of my sculpture and direct the proceeds to CAE, which would help keep the arts alive in NYC by providing arts education access for public school kids.About The Center for Arts EducationThe Center for Arts Education (CAE) is leading the change to restore quality arts education for every one of New York Cityäó»s more than one million public school students. They champion arts powered learning through three channels:Developing model teaching and learning programs for schools, parents, cultural organizations, and teaching artistsHelping parents become advocates as a part of their childrenäó»s art's educationWorking with elected officials and decision-makers to influence policies that will support public school arts educationLearn more about CAE at Visit CAE! or join their community on Facebook"

Weäó»d like to do a small First Edition production run of this brand new - hot off the workbench - fun pop-up-drawing.This design solves a 4-year challenge of ours: finding an artful way to reproduce our innovative concave drawings.You can understand our predicament. Afterall, reproducing 'concave' drawings on any 'flat' surface isäó_well, impossible. That rules out almost all modes of mass-display: books, photos, computer screens, etc. Everything is flat, and for good reason, flat = space efficient. However, one happy medium bridges both worldsäó_the pop-up! :)Our design is complete, engineered to a T, and weäó»re sourcing a manufacturer. Talking shop with several assembly houses, weäó»re just about ready to move. This is where you come in.Hereäó»s part of an email from one of the companies weäó»ve been communicating with:äóìI am in absolute awe of your pop up engineering ability. This is unbelievable. Your design is one of the most intricate Iäó»ve seen. Now for the bad news äóñ itäó»s going to be expensive to produce.äóThis manufacturer is the leading contender for the bid. And weäó»re glad sheäó»s on board. Itäó»s been tough to convince anyone to take this on; people are just spooked by the complexity. But you are not!With your help, her teams can hit the ground running with our design, buckle down with glue and paper, and the First Edition Oakes-pop-up will be born!Check out our prizes to the right for varying levels of support. Any amount you donate will be greatly appreciated.Thank you,Ryan & Trevor Oakes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -The image on this concave pop-up is of The Field Museum in Chicago.

1438," Learning ""to see"" is the most fundamental task for an artist. Drawing directly from life in ink has taught me to trust my hand and eye connection as I must live with the lines I put on the paper. And it also has taught me to let go, and risk, being in the moment, to put the lines down with spirit and conviction, win or lose. My lines do have this spirit of life. The ultimate use of the creative process is about transforming our consciousness and living sustainably in harmony with all life.In 2000 I published a book of ink drawings produced over 16 years on the NYC Subway. This book has been well received and sold in the MTA Transit Museums. For this new project I will pull together a much broader spectrum of drawings from the last 40 years. Living and working in New York City has provided me with fertile ground to cultivate ideas and observe the greatest human diversity on the planet. This exciting book will include drawings of subway riders; buildings and locals (e.g., bars, cafes, restaurants, waiting rooms, music events, poetry readings); portraits of the wonderful people I have been blessed to meet; and studies from the great master works in museums; The LIVING LINE will also document the development of themes and ideas I have explored through line drawing..The ""LIVING LINE: A 40 Year Odyssey Through Drawings"" will be at least 100 pages and have between 75 - 150 ink drawings interspersed with NY stories, insights about life in the city, and thoughts about culture and the creative process. There will be a limited 75 hardcover Collector Edition books available plus a soft-cover edition for wider distribution. This book will provide an intimate look at life through the sensitive eyes of an artist.It is very important to me to get my work out there for people to see and enjoy. Having spent my entire adult life translating the world around me into ink lines, has offered me the opportunity to be an observer, to collect impressions and see much of what others pass by unnoticed. Being an artist and learning ""to see"", and drawing continuously over many years, has kept me connected to life in an honest and passionate way. I hope this book becomes a reality and you too have the opportunity to take this odyssey through the living line. One of my main goals as an artist and a man, is to bring my expertise of the Creative Process to personally transform myself to a higher level of consciousness, but also to disseminate what I know and have learned to others. Without widespread use and understanding of the creative process, we lessen our ability to envision, actualize and sustain life on this planet.If you know me and my work or not, this is your opportunity to jump in and be part of of the creative process with me. I want your support so I can bring these drawings together in a meaningful way and share them with others. This is your opportunity to support my life's work.The money collected will pay for compilation, layout / design, printing, launch and distribution plus payment processing fees, and I hope new drawings.The holidays are coming and this will make a perfect gift. I do appreciate very much your interest and I know you will return again and again to look at the ""living lines"" in this book.I will list all my backers in the book to so their vital support will be acknowledged and always be with the book.Here is a link to view a selection of drawings by Richard Gins:http://www.facebook.com/album.php...Here's a link to my Subway Rider book:http://www.youtube.com/watch...Thanks again,Richard Gins"
1439," -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What is The Endangered Species Print Project (ESPP)? :The Endangered Species Print Project offers limited-edition prints of critically endangered species. The number of prints available corresponds with the remaining animal or plant populations.For example, only 35 Amur Leopards remain in the wild, so for this edition, only 35 prints will ever be made.All net proceeds from ESPP are donated to conservation organizations. A different organization, whose mission is to the ensure the survival of the specie depicted, is chosen for each print.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can you Tell Me More?ESPP is the brainchild of Chicago-based artists Molly Schafer and Jenny Kendler. The project was born from the desire to operate outside the white-wall gallery system and use their artistic talents to support conservation efforts and biodiversity on Planet Earth. ESPP is a labor of love for Schafer and Kendler, who manage all aspects of the project and the creation of the original artwork, along with their day-jobs and individual artistic practices. As the project progresses, ESPP will be releasing additional prints on a monthly basis, including works by guest artists.Since information on these rare species can be hard to come by, the ESPP site also features short articles on each species. Schafer and Kendler are in close touch with researchers working in the field to confirm the accuracy of their information and to stay up to date on news and population counts. The net proceeds from the sale of all prints goes directly to these researchers & organizations assisting in the conservation of these highly endangered creatures.The first five prints offered by ESPP are: The Panamanian Golden Frog, The Vancouver Island Marmot, The Seychelles Sheath-tailed Bat, The Indri Lemur and The Amur Leopard (being posted soon!). ESPP's first guest artist will also soon be posting the amazing Giant Gomeran Lizard as ESPP's 6th print.These species are all critically endangered --- and it just so happens, rather charming. The vibrant prints, mash-ups of science and whimsy, are highly limited editions. So get yours before they disappear --- and help prevent these species from disappearing too!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How are Things Going With ESPP?ESPP has received very positive responses and has recently been featured on the home pages of Juxtapoz Magazine, Cool Hunting, Design Milk, Pikaland, OMG Posters!, and was written up in the Sierra Club's blog: The Green Life. ESPP continues to work with other conservation organizations and has upcoming plans to collaborate on prints and promotions with the Center for Biological Diversity. As the project moves into late 2009 and 2010, ESPP will be actively seeking funding to increase it's scope and effectiveness.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please check out our website at: http://endangeredspeciesprintproject.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why is ESPP asking for your donation?:ESPP is a not for profit venture. We do not make an income managing or illustrating for the project. Artists donate both their time and work. The cost of the prints cover the production costs and fund the associated conservation organization.Right now anyone who buys a print from ESPP, since ESPP is not a 501(c)(3), must pay us in two separate transactions for tax reasons --- one check or online payment to reimburse our expenses and one payment that will be donated directly to the conservation organization. We would like to streamline this process into a one transaction method. The intent is to both streamline the sales process and be able to give a larger amount of the sale of prints to the conservation organizations.Because of the two payment transaction being complicated, confusing and inconvenient for people, we believe that we are getting fewer sales, and these critically endangered species are left with less money to ensure their survival. The high number of hits we receive on our website vs. the lower number of sales seems to point to the difficult transaction process.Because of this, we'd like to be funded through Kickstarter to cover our own personal expenditures, which include the following production costs of:- Printing- Recycled Mailers- Glassine Sleeves- Postage- ShippingWe consider the time that we spend creating the artwork and the artwork itself to be donated, but because we both work full-time jobs in addition to working on the very time-consuming ESPP, we are hoping for support on our personal efforts.If we are funded to cover our expenses, then people can make just one payment when they purchase and ESPP print.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Best Part!:The best part is that once funded we can then give 100% of our next 100 sales to the associated conservation organizations --- doubling the amount of funds that go to these amazing groups working in the field to preserve biodiversity! Some of these organizations are very small and focused, so have few other sources of funding. We can make a big difference if we all work together to help them out.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Goal:Our goal is $2500, enough to fund 100 prints or more and with their sale on our site, to raise $5000 or more for conservation --- but we would love to double or even triple that amount!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
